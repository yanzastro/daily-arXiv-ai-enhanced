ABCMB is a complete code capturing important effects to linear order in $Λ{\\rm CDM}$ cosmology. It computes the CMB power spectrum and includes effects like lensing, polarization, massive neutrinos, and a state-of-the-art treatment of BBN and recombination. ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files. ABCMB provides accurate and stable gradients to the user, making Fisher analyses straightforward, and enabling the use of efficient gradient-based sampling methods."}

With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}

Large language model (LLM)-integrated home energy management systems (HEMS) have shown promise, but prior studies relied on prompt engineering or pre-built platforms with limited customization of agent behavior, or assessed performance through single-turn or -task evaluations. This study introduces a multi-agent home energy management assistant (HEMA), built on LangChain and LangGraph, designed to adaptively and intelligently handle real-world use cases of HEMS with full system customization capability. It carefully classifies user queries via a self-consistency classifier, requests three specialized agents (Analysis, Knowledge, and Control) to prepare accurate, adaptive responses using purpose-built analysis and control tools and retrieval augmented generation under the reasoning and acting mechanism. HEMA was rigorously assessed using two different experimental analyses via an LLM-as-user approach: (1) analytical and informative capabilities using combinatorial test cases of various personas and differing scenarios against three alternative system configurations relying on vanilla LLM and (2) control capabilities using various control scenarios. Out of 295 test cases, HEMA acquired a 91.9% goal achievement rate, successfully fulfilling user requests while providing high levels of factual accuracy, action correctness, interaction quality, and system efficiency, especially when compared to alternative system configurations. Collectively, this study contributes to the advancement of the human-centered design of LLM-integrated HEMS by demonstrating the feasibility and value of agentic architectures, and by clarifying the architectural requirements and evaluation criteria necessary to support adaptive, sustained human-artificial intelligence collaboration in HEMS."}

This growth rate far outpaces transistor scaling, leading to unsustainably rising costs, energy consumption, and emissions. Semiconductor manufacturing is no exception. Computational lithography -- involving transferring circuitry to silicon in diffraction-limited conditions -- is the largest workload in semiconductor manufacturing. It has also grown exceptionally complex as miniaturization has advanced in the angstrom-era, requiring more accurate modeling, intricate corrections, and broader solution-space exploration. Accelerated computing (AC) offers a solution by dramatically freeing up the compute and power envelope. AI augments these gains by serving as high-fidelity surrogates for compute-intensive steps. Together, they present a sustainable, next-generation computing platform for scientific workloads. This new paradigm needs a fundamental redesign of the software stack. For computational lithography, NVIDIA cuLitho reinvents the core primitives -- diffractive optics, computational geometry, multi-variant optimization, data processing -- to achieve a transformative 57X end-to-end acceleration. Beyond dramatically faster cycles, this expanded compute envelope enables more rigorous solutions, including curvilinear masks, high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (high-NA EUV) lithography, and subatomic modeling. We reinvest a small fraction of the freed-up compute to include through-focus correction for better process resilience. Silicon experiments at IMEC show significant benefits compared to conventional methods -- 35% better process window and 19% better edge placement error. This is the first quantified chip-scale demonstration of the lithography benefits of AC and AI in silicon."}

How energetic constraints shape synaptic precision and its regulation during plasticity remains unclear. Here we develop an energy--constrained framework in which synapses minimise postsynaptic response variance subject to a fixed mean and an effective energy budget. Combinations of candidate physiological costs are used to estimate an energy cost for synaptic transmission; this cost is then inferred from quantal statistics. Analysing five published pre- and post-plasticity datasets, we find that observed synaptic mean--variance pairs cluster near a minimal-energy boundary, indicating that precision is limited by energetic availability. Model comparison identifies a dominant calcium pump-like cost paired with a smaller vesicle turnover-like cost, yielding a separable precision--energy relationship, $σ^{-2} \\propto E^5$. We further show that plasticity systematically updates synaptic energy budgets according to the scale-free magnitude of mean change, enabling accurate prediction of post-plasticity variance from energy allocation alone. These results provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that synaptic precision is governed by energy budgets, establishing energy allocation as a fundamental principle linking metabolic constraints, synaptic reliability, and plasticity."}

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

We address this gap by evaluating a prototype that fuses robot-mounted depth sensing and YOLO detection with a vision language model (VLM) capable of verbalizing metrically-grounded distances of detected objects (e.g., the chair is 3.02 meters away). In a mixed-reality toxic-smoke scenario, participants estimated distances to a victim and an exit window under three conditions: video-only, depth-agnostic VLM, and depth-augmented VLM. Depth-augmentation improved objective accuracy and stability, e.g., the victim and window distance estimation error dropped, while raising situational awareness without increasing workload. Conversely, depth- agnostic assistance increased workload and slightly worsened accuracy. We contribute to human SA augmentation by demonstrating that metrically grounded, object-centric verbal information supports spatial reasoning in EFR and improves decision-relevant judgments under time pressure."}

PPG provides a low-cost complement that captures autonomic signatures effective for detecting light sleep. However, prior PPG-based methods rely on full night recordings (8 - 10 hours) as input context, which is less practical to provide timely feedback for sleep intervention. In this work, we investigate scEEG-PPG fusion for 4-class sleep staging under short-window (30 s - 30 min) constraints. First, we evaluate the temporal context required for each modality, to better understand the relationship of sleep staging performance with respect to monitoring window. Second, we investigate three fusion strategies: score-level fusion, cross-attention fusion enabling feature-level interactions, and Mamba-enhanced fusion incorporating temporal context modeling. Third, we train and evaluate on the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) dataset and perform cross-dataset validation on the Cleveland Family Study (CFS) and the Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) datasets. The Mamba-enhanced fusion achieves the best performance on MESA (Cohen's Kappa $κ$ = 0.798, Acc = 86.9%), with particularly notable improvement in light sleep classification (F1-score: 85.63% vs. 77.76%, recall: 82.85% vs. 69.95% for scEEG alone), and generalizes well to CFS and ABC datasets with different populations. These findings suggest that scEEG-PPG fusion is a promising approach for lightweight wearable based sleep monitoring, offering a pathway toward more accessible sleep health assessment.

Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff > 6000 K) and cool (Teff < 6000 K) populations. Cross-matching with Gaia DR3, we find that 47.7% of our barium stars within 1 kpc have elevated re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE >= 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE < 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] < -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy."}

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}

The approach is to increase the element size and use advanced beamformers to maintain image quality. The delay and sum (DAS), Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), directional coherence factor (DCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers were compared. K-wave simulations of the 3D point-spread functions (PSF) of NSI, DCF, and MV display reduced side lobes and narrowed main lobes compared to DAS. Experiments were conducted using a multiplexed 1024-element matrix array on a Verasonics 256 system. Elements were electronically coupled to imitate a larger pitch and element size. Then, a virtual large aperture was created by using a positioning system to collect data in sections with the matrix array. High-quality images were obtained using a coupling factor of two, doubling the FOV while maintaining the same element count in the virtual large aperture as the original matrix array. The NSI beamformer demonstrated the best resolution performance in simulations and on the large aperture, maintaining the same resolution as uncoupled DAS for coupling factors up to 4.

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave."}

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."}

I discuss the convergence between the pedagogically-derived framework and Sharma et al.'s empirically-derived taxonomy, and argue that this convergence--two independent approaches arriving at similar problem descriptions--strengthens the case for both the diagnosis and the proposed educational response."}

However, existing ISAC systems face fundamental limitations in achieving high-resolution sensing while maintaining robust communication security and spectral efficiency. This paper introduces a transformative approach leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-functional SIM-assisted system that jointly optimizes communication secrecy and sensing accuracy through a novel layered optimization framework. Our solution employs a multi-objective optimization formulation that balances secrecy rate maximization with sensing error minimization under practical hardware constraints. The proposed layered block coordinate descent algorithm efficiently coordinates sensing configuration, secure beamforming, communication metasurface optimization, and resource allocation while ensuring robustness to channel uncertainties. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional approaches, achieving 32-61\\% improvement in sensing accuracy and 15-35\\% enhancement in secrecy rates while maintaining computational efficiency.

Our results provide strong evidence for significant differences ($\\sim$3$σ$) between the triggering mechanisms of the different sub-types of powerful radio AGN. The high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) show a high rate of morphological disturbance (62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent) -- an excess of $\\sim$4$σ$ compared with the control sample -- consistent with them being predominantly triggered in galaxy mergers and interactions. In contrast, the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) show a much lower rate of morphological disturbance (36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent), consistent with the control sample, and suggesting a different dominant triggering mechanism, such as the accretion of gas from the hot X-ray haloes of the host galaxies or galaxy clusters. We also demonstrate that, when considering the radio morphology, the FRII HERG sources preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies, a difference of $\\sim$3$σ$ to the FRII LERG objects. This suggests that the FRII LERG sources do not solely represent a `switched-off' phase in the HERG lifecycle of the same parent galaxy population as the FRII HERGs."}

The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism.\n  Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines."}

Cooley-Tukey-based approximations inherit the intermediate multiplications by twiddled factors which are usually not approximated; otherwise the effected error propagation would prevent the overall good performance of the approximation. In this context, the prime factor algorithm can furnish the necessary framework for deriving fully multiplierless DFT approximations. We introduced an approximation method based on small prime-sized DFT approximations which entirely eliminates intermediate multiplication steps and prevents internal error propagation. To demonstrate the proposed method, we design a fully multiplierless 1023-point DFT approximation based on 3-, 11- and 31-point DFT approximations. The performance evaluation according to popular metrics showed that the proposed approximations not only presented a significantly lower arithmetic complexity but also resulted in smaller approximation error measurements when compared to competing methods."}

But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres."}

We compare the properties (morphologies, the presence of interactions, rest-frame colours and environment) of our AGN to galaxies in a control sample, which are drawn from the non-variable population and matched in redshift and stellar mass to their AGN counterparts. The fraction of AGN with early-type morphology ($\\sim$55 per cent) and the fraction that is interacting ($\\sim$23 per cent) are similar to what is observed in the controls, suggesting that these AGN are not primarily triggered by interactions. Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe."}

We present a theoretical framework based on the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model. We extracted portions of simulated volumes that include isolated galaxies, pairs, group, and filament members at z ~ 0, specifically avoiding massive clusters. Galaxies were classified using both intrinsic (halo-based) and observational (2D projected) parameterizations, reconstructing their environmental histories from z = 2 and identifying mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), and starvation. 2D information decreases isolated and group fractions while doubles pairs. More than half of galaxies remain unaffected by the investigated processes since z = 2. Among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40-60% at log(M*/Msun) > 10.5). Tidal interactions are less frequent, and their incidence increases with stellar mass. RPS dominates in groups and filaments at intermediate masses (~50%), while starvation ranges from 20 to 30%. The incidence of the different mechanisms depends strongly on both mass and environment, though their imprints on global properties are often subtle. Distinct evolutionary pathways emerge: log(M*/Msun) < 9.5, galaxies in groups and filaments have a faster mass growth than galaxies in the other environments, especially those undergoing starvation, mergers and, to less extent, RPS. Differences are reduced moving to higher masses, where no clear dependence on physical mechanism emerge, even though at these masses a clear star formation suppression is evident in mergers and starved galaxies.

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies."}

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

However, conventional BP writing remains a rigid, linear process that often fails to reflect the dynamic and recursive nature of entrepreneurial ideation. This mismatch is particularly challenging for novice entrepreneurial students, who struggle with the substantial cognitive demands of developing and refining ideas. While reflection and meta-reflection are critical strategies for fostering divergent and convergent thinking, existing writing tools rarely scaffold these higher-order processes. To address this gap, we present the Meflex System, a large language model (LLM)-based writing tool that integrates BP writing scaffolding with a nonlinear idea canvas to support iterative ideation through reflection and meta-reflection. We report findings from an exploratory user study with 30 participants that examined the system's usability and cognitive impact. Results show that Meflex effectively scaffolds BP writing, promotes divergent thinking through LLM-supported reflection, and enhances meta-reflective awareness while reducing cognitive load during complex idea development. These findings highlight the potential of non-linear LLM-based writing tools to foster deeper and coherent entrepreneurial thinking."}

Conventionally, background learning is performed after transforming measurements into the range-Doppler domain, a step that is computationally expensive and can obscure phase-coherent structure useful for monitoring and tracking. This paper proposes a framework for learning and tracking the multipath background directly in the raw measurement domain. Starting from a wideband Doppler linearization of the impulse response of a time-varying multipath channel, a state-space model with a heteroscedastic measurement equation is derived. This model enables channel tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and unknown model parameters are learned from the marginalized likelihood. The statistical adequacy of the proposed models is assessed via a p-value significance test. Finally, this paper integrates the learned channel model into a sequential likelihood-ratio test for target detection. BELLHOP-based simulations show that the proposed model better captures channel dynamics induced by sea-surface fluctuations and transmitter and receiver drift, yielding more reliable detection in time-varying shallow-water environments"}

The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]"}

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave."}

Strategic AI Disclosure in Crowdfunding", "comment": null, "summary": "As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates into crowdfunding practices, strategic disclosure of AI involvement has become critical. Yet, empirical insights into how different disclosure strategies influence investor decisions remain limited. Drawing on signaling theory and Aristotle's rhetorical framework, we examine how mandatory AI disclosure affects crowdfunding performance and how substantive signals (degree of AI involvement) and rhetorical signals (logos/explicitness, ethos/authenticity, pathos/emotional tone) moderate these effects. Leveraging Kickstarter's mandatory AI disclosure policy as a natural experiment and four supplementary online experiments, we find that mandatory AI disclosure significantly reduces crowdfunding performance: funds raised decline by 39.8% and backer counts by 23.9% for AI-involved projects. However, this adverse effect is systematically moderated by disclosure strategy. Greater AI involvement amplifies the negative effects of AI disclosure, while high authenticity and high explicitness mitigate them. Interestingly, excessive positive emotional tone (a strategy creators might intuitively adopt to counteract AI skepticism) backfires and exacerbates negative outcomes. Supplementary randomized experiments identify two underlying mechanisms: perceived creator competence and AI washing concerns. Substantive signals primarily affect competence judgments, whereas rhetorical signals operate through varied pathways: either mediator alone or both in sequence. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights for entrepreneurs, platforms, and policymakers strategically managing AI transparency in high-stakes investment contexts."}

We identify 1285 individual GMCs and measure the fundamental properties (radius, velocity dispersion, and molecular gas mass) of each with a modified version of the CPROPStoo package. Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not.

We first introduce probabilistic human response models for these rich queries motivated by the relationship experimentally observed between the perceived implicit score of an item and its distance to the unknown classifier. Using these models, we then design active learning algorithms that leverage the rich queries to increase the information gained per interaction. We provide theoretical bounds on sample complexity and develop a tractable and computationally efficient variational approximation. Through experiments with simulated annotators derived from crowdsourced word-sentiment and image-aesthetic datasets, we demonstrate significant reductions on sample complexity. We further extend active learning strategies to select queries that maximize information rate, explicitly balancing informational value against annotation cost. This algorithm in the word sentiment classification task reduces learning time by more than 57\\% compared to traditional label-only active learning."}

However, reconstructing the reflectivity of the medium from partial boundary measurements remains a challenging problem, particularly when the background wave speed is unknown. In this paper, we investigate passive correlation-based imaging in the daylight configuration, where uncontrolled noise sources illuminate the medium and only ambient fields are recorded by a sensor array. We first analyze daylight migration for a point reflector embedded in a homogeneous background. By introducing a searching wave speed into the migration functional, we derive an explicit characterization of the deterministic shift and defocusing effects induced by wave-speed mismatch. We show that the maximum of the envelope of the resulting functional provides a reliable estimator of the true wave speed. We then extend the analysis to a random medium with correlation length smaller than the wavelength. Leveraging the shift formula obtained in the homogeneous case, we introduce a virtual guide star that remains fixed under migration with different searching speeds. This property enables an effective wave-speed estimation strategy based on spatial averaging around the virtual guide star. For both homogeneous and random media, we establish resolution analyses for the proposed wave-speed estimators. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical result."}

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies."}

We formulate semantic adaptation driven by human feedback as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) whose state captures semantic quality, human preferences, queue slack, and channel dynamics, and solve it via a primal--dual proximal policy optimization algorithm with action shielding and latency-aware reward shaping. The resulting policy preserves PPO-level semantic rewards while tightening the variability of both air-interface and near-real-time RAN intelligent controller processing budgets. Simulations over point-to-multipoint links with heterogeneous deadlines show that TC-HITL-RL consistently meets per-user timing constraints, outperforms baseline schedulers in reward, and stabilizes resource consumption, providing a practical blueprint for latency-aware semantic adaptation."}

For configuration, geometry-driven analytical approaches are appealing for their simplicity and real-time operation, but their performance in challenging environments such as industrial halls with dense multipath and metallic scattering is not well established. To this end, we present a measurement-based evaluation of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in a large industrial hall using a 5 GHz RIS prototype. A novel RIS configuration is proposed in which four patch antennas are mounted in close proximity in front of the RIS to steer the incident field and enable controlled reflection. For this setup, analytically computed, quantized configurations are implemented. Two-dimensional received power maps from two measurement areas reveal consistent, spatially selective focusing. Configurations optimized near the receiver produce clear power maxima, while steering to offset locations triggers a rapid 20-30 dB reduction. With increasing RIS-receiver distance, elevation selectivity broadens due to finite-aperture and geometric constraints, while azimuth steering remains robust. These results confirm the practical viability of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in industrial environments and support its use for spatial field control and localization under non-ideal propagation."}
