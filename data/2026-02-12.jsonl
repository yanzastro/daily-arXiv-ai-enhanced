Traditional artifact removal methods are often computationally expensive and inefficient for real-time applications in edge devices. This paper presents a method to reduce the computational cost of most existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) by replacing one-dimensional (1-D) CNNs with two-dimensional (2-D) CNNs and deploys them on Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is an open-resource hardware accelerator widely used in edge devices for low-latency, low-power operation. A new Efficient 2D-CNN Artifact Removal (E2CAR) framework is also represented using the method above, and it achieves a 90\\% reduction in inference time on the TPU and decreases power consumption by 18.98\\%, while maintaining comparable artifact removal performance to existing methods. This approach facilitates efficient EEG signal processing on edge devices."}

Machine learning (ML)-based localization using channel state information (CSI) is one of the most popular methods for achieving high-accuracy localization with low cost. However, to be accurate and robust, ML-based algorithms need to be trained and tested with large amounts of data, covering not only many user equipment (UE)/target locations, but also many different access points (APs) locations to which the UEs connect, in a variety of different environment types. This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: > 12 million UE locations, > 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and > 30 streets for outdoor use. The paper describes the dataset structure, measurement environments, measurement protocols, and the dataset validations. Comprehensive case studies validate the advantages of large datasets in ML-driven localization strategies for both \"standard\" and transfer learning. We envision this dataset, which is by far the largest of its kind, to become a standard resource for researchers in the field of ML-based localization."}

However, practical deployment remains constrained by challenges in accurate channel estimation and control optimization under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a foundation model-aided hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (FM-HDRL) framework designed for joint beamforming and phase-shift optimization in RIS-assisted wireless networks. To implement this, we first fine-tune a pre-trained large wireless model (LWM) to translate raw channel data into low-dimensional, context-aware channel state information (CSI) embeddings. Next, these embeddings are combined with user location information and blockage status to select the optimal communication path. The resulting features are then fed into an HDRL model, assumed to be implemented at a centralized controller, which jointly optimizes the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and the RIS phase-shift configurations to maximize SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FM-HDRL framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, spectral efficiency, and scalability. According to the simulation results, our proposed method improves 7.82% SE compared to the FM-aided deep reinforcement learning (FM-DRL) approach and a substantial enhancement of about 48.66% relative to the beam sweeping approach."}

Particularly, leveraging LEO satellites and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), ISTNs offer promising solutions but face significant challenges due to diverse terrestrial environments, user and satellite mobility, and long propagation LEO-to-ground distance. To address these challenges, digitial-twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to offer virtual replicas of real-world systems, facilitating prediction for resource management. In this work, we study a time-window-based DT-aided DSS framework for ISTNs, enabling joint long-term and short-term resource decisions to reduce system congestion. Based on that, two optimization problems are formulated, which aim to optimize resource management using DT information and to refine obtained solutions with actual real-time information, respectively. To efficiently solve these problems, we proposed algorithms using compressed-sensing-based and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results using actual traffic data and the London 3D map demonstrate the superiority in terms of congestion minimization of our proposed algorithms compared to benchmarks.

Many existing methods conflate these observation artifacts with genuine neural influence, risking spurious causal graphs driven by the measurement process. We introduce INCAMA (INdirect CAusal MAmba), a latent-space causal discovery framework that explicitly accounts for measurement physics to separate neural dynamics from indirect observations. INCAMA integrates a physics-aware inversion module with a nonstationarity-driven, delay-sensitive causal discovery model based on selective state-space sequences. Leveraging nonstationary mechanism shifts as soft interventions, we establish identifiability of delayed causal structure from indirect measurements and a stability bound that quantifies how inversion error affects graph recovery. We validate INCAMA on large-scale biophysical simulations across EEG and fMRI, where it significantly outperforms standard pipelines. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to real-world fMRI from the Human Connectome Project: without domain-specific fine-tuning, INCAMA recovers canonical visuo-motor pathways (e.g., $V1 \\to V2$ and $M1 \\leftrightarrow S1$) consistent with established neuroanatomy, supporting its use for whole-brain causal inference."}

Their enhanced sensitivity to feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) make them excellent laboratories to test whether feedback prescriptions in cosmological simulations accurately reproduce their interstellar medium (ISM) properties. We present JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of nine dwarf galaxies from COSMOS-Web survey at redshift $z<0.08$, with star formation rates ranging from 0.003-0.3 M${\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of log M$_{\\ast}\\sim8-9$ M$_{\\odot}$. The detection rate with both NIRCam and MIRI is 100\\%, indicating that these dwarfs possess substantial ISM content.

We find that the observed MIRI flux distributions are comparable to forward-modelled flux distributions of mass-matched simulated galaxies in TNG50. We further conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis complementing the JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging with archival HST/ACS data, employing the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) framework. Among the multi-wavelength images, MIRI exhibits the largest variation in CAS parameters, likely due to dust lanes and clumps in several galaxies, also suggested by Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. This suggests that the dust content in these systems may be higher than those implied by rest-frame optical or near-infrared observations alone. Upcoming UV/optical and mid-infrared spectroscopic follow-up will be critical for constraining the gas kinematics and dust grain properties of dwarf galaxies in low-density environments such as COSMOS."}

To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \\texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model."}

Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$α$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$α$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \\hi\\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z>5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]"}

Imperfect channel state information (CSI) is considered for all links, where robustness is ensured by modeling channel estimation errors within a bounded uncertainty region, guaranteeing worst-case performance reliability. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework. The precoding subproblem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via linear matrix inequalities derived using the S-procedure. The RIS reflection matrix is optimized using successive convex approximation (SCA), yielding an equivalent SDP formulation. The MA position optimization is addressed through SCA combined with block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

The red fraction decreases steadily until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses. This 'U' shape demonstrates that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' (i.e. that progressively lower mass galaxies maintain star formation until later epochs) is incorrect -- downsizing does not continue uninterrupted into the dwarf regime. The U shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that it is driven by internal processes rather than external environment-driven mechanisms. Our results suggest that, at Mstar < 10^8 MSun, the quenching of star formation is dominated by supernova (SN) feedback and becomes more effective with decreasing stellar mass, as the potential well becomes shallower. At Mstar > 10^9 MSun, the quenching is driven by a mix of SN feedback and AGN feedback (which becomes more effective with increasing stellar mass, as central black holes become more massive). The processes that quench star formation are least effective in the range 10^8 MSun < Mstar < 10^9 MSun, likely because the potential well is deep enough to weaken the impact of SN feedback, while the effect of AGN feedback is still insignificant. The cosmological simulations tested here do not match the details of how the red fraction varies as a function of stellar mass -- we propose that the red fraction vs stellar mass relation (particularly in the dwarf regime) is a powerful calibrator for the processes that regulate star formation in galaxy formation models."}

While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope."}

Building walls introduce considerable attenuation on the radar signals. When the transmitted power is raised to compensate the through-wall attenuation, the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver can saturate the receiver because of which weaker reflections off the target may remain undetected. In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas. The system is tested in through-wall conditions."}

The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\\sim10^{6}$ M$_\\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\\odot$."}

This finding challenges the standard $Λ$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $ξχ^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data."}

However, deploying separate radars and communication devices involves the allocation of individual frequency bands and hardware platforms. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a robust solution to the challenges of spectral congestion by utilizing a shared waveform, hardware, and spectrum for both localization of mobile users and communication. Various waveforms, including phase-modulated continuous waves (PMCW) and frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW), have been explored for target localization using traditional radar. On the other hand, new protocols such as the IEEE 802.11ad have been proposed to support wideband communication between vehicles. This paper compares both traditional radar and communication candidate waveforms for ISAC to detect single-point and extended targets. We show that the response of FMCW to mobile targets is poorer than that of PMCW. However, the IEEE 802.11ad radar outperforms PMCW radar and FMCW radar. Additionally, the radar signal processing algorithms are implemented on Zynq system-on-chip through hardware-software co-design and fixed-point analysis to evaluate their computational complexity in real-world implementations."}

However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations."}

From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \\equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs."}

While substantial research has been devoted to motion compensation of single-channel ISAR images, the effectiveness of these methods for MIMO-ISAR has not been studied extensively. This paper analyzes the performance of three popular motion compensation techniques - entropy minimization, cross-correlation, and phase gradient autofocus - on MIMO-ISAR. The algorithms are evaluated on the measurement data collected using Texas Instruments millimeter-wave MIMO radar. The results indicate that the cross-correlation MOCOMP performs better than the other two MOCOMP algorithms in the MIMO configuration, with an overall improvement of 36%."}

However, the composition and structure of dust in distant galaxies are still poorly understood. We have started a JWST MIRI MRS program investigating the dust features in gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts $z<$1.2, with strong 2175~Å bumps detected in absorption along the lines of sight to distant background quasars. Here we describe our program strategy, and present MIRI MRS observations of IR dust features at $z=0.5-1.2$ in five quasar spectra that form the first part of our full sample. We identify artifacts in MIRI MRS data that affect the background in IFU cubes, and propose methods to reduce their effects. We pay special attention to modeling the quasar mid-IR continuum, which shows significant variation depending on AGN morphology, redshift, and black hole mass. Dust in foreground galaxies produces significant absorption from the 10~$μ$m silicate feature in all five quasar spectra. Compared with the average 10~$μ$m silicate feature in the diffuse ISM of the Milky Way, we find differences in the absorption peak position, width of the features, and asymmetry of the profiles. A detailed study of these silicate features is presented in our next paper (Klimenko et al. 2026b). In two quasar spectra, we tentatively detect weak IR features near 3.0 and 3.4~$μ$m. Their strengths are comparable to those seen in the Milky Way ISM, but follow-up observations are required to confirm these detections."}

Such DS decays into Standard Model (SM) states can modify the late-time thermal history of the IGM, making Lyman-$α$ data a sensitive probe of hidden sectors with cosmologically long lifetimes. Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space. We further revisit limits on such decaying DS models from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and provide updates relevant for DS lifetimes longer than $10^{14}$ s. The model-independent constraints on the DS parameter space we derive in this work can be reinterpreted for a wide range of decaying hidden-sector scenarios, including evaporating primordial black holes and SM-coupled dark photons."}

Our dataset analysis reveals that our collected interaction traces quantitatively confirm distinct interaction styles between SU and BLVU groups (mouse- vs. keyboard-dominant) and demonstrate interaction diversity within each group (sequential vs. shortcut navigation for BLVUs). We then compare collected traces to state-of-the-art CUAs under default and AT conditions (keyboard-only, magnifier). The default CUA executed 78.3% of tasks successfully.

Using the population-agnostic energetic formalism, we treat the AGN-disk channel as a mass-flow pipeline connecting the stellar-mass black hole population observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) to the SMBH mass reservoir via IMBHs. By anchoring this estimate to the LVK merger rate densities and the cosmic SMBH mass density derived from scaling relations, we derive a limit on the background amplitude. We show that the total energy density of the background is bounded by the global mass budget of SMBH growth. For fiducial parameters consistent with the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4), this yields a characteristic strain $A_{\\rm IMR} \\simeq (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\\times 10^{-21}$ at $3\\,{\\rm mHz}$. While this fiducial amplitude is subdominant to the Galactic white dwarf foreground and the stellar-mass Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) background, we show it can be distinguished by its non-Gaussian statistics and higher frequency cutoff. This new background may be detectable in the decihertz band where proposed detectors such as the Big Bang Observer or long-baseline lunar interferometers can measure it cleanly. A detection would provide a direct, model-independent constraint on the efficiency with which AGN disks process stellar remnants into SMBH mass growth, linking the LVK and LISA bands."}

The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\\ell \\in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3σ$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $ρ_{\\ell}^{\\rm tSZ \\times CIB}$, finding $3.1σ$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\\ell > 2500$. This result represents the deepest tSZ maps ever produced and provides new constraints that can help refine astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium."}

We qualitatively analyzed 522 Reddit threads to understand what drives remote caregivers' online help-seeking behaviors and the responses they receive from the community. Their purposes of posting included requesting guidance, expressing emotions, and seeking validation. Community responses included providing emotional support, suggesting informational strategies, and sharing personal experiences. While certain themes in posts (emotional toll, monitoring symptoms, and prioritizing caregiver well-being) are shared across remote and non-remote contexts, remote caregivers' posts surfaced nuanced experiences. For example, they often rely on digital cues, such as voice, to interpret care receivers' well-being while struggling with digital silence during crises. We discuss the need for supporting communication and information sharing between remote caregivers and receivers, care coordination for crisis management, and design recommendations for caregiver communities."}

We first introduce the fundamentals of CSS, including the general framework, classical detector design, and fusion strategies. Then, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on AI-driven CSS, classified into three categories: discriminative deep learning (DL) models, generative DL models, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, we explore semantic communication (SemCom) as a promising solution for CSS, in which task-oriented representations are exchanged to reduce reporting overhead while preserving decision-critical information. Finally, we discuss limitations, open challenges, and future research directions at the intersection of AI and wireless communication."}

Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$α$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$α$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \\hi\\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z>5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]"}

As an exploratory step, we conducted co-design sessions with 20 university students diagnosed with ADHD, followed by interviews with five experts specialized in ADHD intervention.

The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available.

The normalized [\\ion{C}{1}] to CS~7--6 intensity difference decreases inwardly from $R=4$~pc to 1.7~pc and azimuthally along the CND's rotation, likely tracing paths of low-density gas inflow. By projecting spaxels into orbital coordinates assuming a velocity field model, we identify four kinematic features: a pair of spiral outer streamers toward the CND, inner streamers extending to 0.5~pc from Sgr~A$^*$, an outer disk at $ R\\sim3$--6~pc, and the rotating ring at $R=2$~pc. $P$--$P$--$V$ correlation between the inner streamers and H42$α$ indicates gas supply to the mini-spiral through the western arc (WA) and northern arm (NA). The total inflowing mass is $1.5\\times10^4~M_\\odot$, 1.7 times the mass of the rotating ring. The identified flows can be organized into two main pathways connecting the CND exterior and interior: ``WA flow'' feeding the mini-spiral WA via the CND, and ``NA flow'' bypassing the purely rotating orbit. The inflow rate along the former is approximately constant (0.1--0.16~$M_\\odot~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), implying a CND dwelling time comparable to its orbital period and supporting the CND's transient nature. We also identify two [\\ion{C}{1}]-bright clumps (CBCs) lacking dense-gas counterparts near the contact point between the northern outer streamer and the CND. Apparently intact against tidal disruption despite subcritical densities, the CBCs may represent a chemically young phase shortly after formation in colliding flows."}

The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\\sim10^{6}$ M$_\\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\\odot$."}

In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains. However, prevailing perspectives often restrict DbA to early ideation or specific data modalities, while reducing AI-driven design to simplified input-output pipelines. Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance. Building on this synthesis, we frame DbA as a mediating technology for human-AI collaboration and outline the potential opportunities and inherent risks for advancing creativity support in HCI and design research."}

Author version", "summary": "Rolling element bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their condition significantly influences system performance, reliability, and operational lifespan. Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications."}

Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that."}

We designed Jokeasy, a search-enabled prototype system that integrates a dual-role LLM agent acting as both a material scout and a prototype writer to support human-AI collaboration in thematic joke writing. Jokeasy provides a visual canvas in which retrieved web content is organized into editable inspiration blocks and developed through a multistage workflow. A qualitative study with 13 hobbyists and 5 expert participants (including professional comedians and HCI/AI specialists) showed that weaving real-time web material into this structured workflow enriches ideation and preserves author agency, while also revealing needs for finer search control, tighter chat-canvas integration, and more flexible visual editing.

Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy."}

We present Earinter, a commodity-earbud-based closed-loop system that integrates in-the-wild sensing, real-time reasoning, and theory-grounded just-in-time (JIT) intervention to regulate eating pace during daily meals. Earinter repurposes the earbud's bone-conduction voice sensor to capture chewing-related vibrations and estimate eating pace as chews per swallow (CPS) for on-device inference. With data collected equally across in-lab and in-the-wild sessions, Earinter achieves reliable chewing detection (F1 = 0.97) and accurate eating pace estimation (MAE: 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.13 chews/min, 3.65 $\\pm$ 3.86 chews/swallow), enabling robust tracking for closed-loop use. Guided by Dual Systems Theory and refined through two Wizard-of-Oz pilots, Earinter adopts a user-friendly design for JIT intervention content and delivery policy in daily meals. In a 13-day within-subject field study (N=14), the closed-loop system significantly increased CPS and reduced food-consumption speed, with statistical signs of carryover on retention-probe days and acceptable user burden.

Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS. Simulations validate the theory and show that the proposed unsupervised MAF-based NP detector achieves performance comparable to its supervised counterpart."}

Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity."}

A prototype HVLS circuit, along with impedance matching and a driver to enable high-speed off-chip testing, was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI process technology.

The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\\%\\pm 7\\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption."}

Together, the costs of robustness in system design, for example, the compromised nominal performances and the extra computational burdens, are discussed. Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning.

CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment."}

Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention.

Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \\pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\\approx 8.2\\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\\prime\\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects."}

To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve."}

In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe."}

RISs, thanks to their intelligent design, can reshape the wireless channel to provide favorable propagation conditions for information transfer. In this work, we experimentally investigate the potential of RISs to enhance the effective rank of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, thereby improving spatial multiplexing capabilities. In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains."}

After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions."}

A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\\odot\\leq M_{cl}(0)\\leq10^5M_\\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\\times10^4M_\\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\\leq3.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift.

The final published version is available at DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2026.101075", "summary": "The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images."}

Lada", "Glen Petitpas"], "title": "Resolved Dust Emission and CO Isotopologues in Giant Molecular Clouds of the Andromeda Galaxy", "comment": "ApJ, in press", "summary": "Dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths can be used to reliably trace the basic properties of molecular clouds. Early results from a recent Submillimeter Array (SMA) survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) include the first detections of resolved dust continuum emission from individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in an external spiral galaxy. This paper updates on the now-complete SMA survey of 80 Herschel-identified giant molecular associations (GMAs) in M31. The SMA survey simultaneously probes dust continuum emission at 230 GHz and the $J = 2 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions of the CO isotopologues, $^{12}\\rm CO$, $^{13}\\rm CO$, and $\\rm C^{18}O$ at a spatial resolution of $\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{pc}$. Dust continuum emission was detected in 71 cloud cores, of which 26 were resolved. This more than doubles the size of the previous sample. By comparing dust and CO observations with identical astrometry, we directly measure the dust mass to-light ratios, $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{12}CO}$, and $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{13}CO}$. We derive $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{12}\\rm CO}>~=~0.070~\\pm~0.031~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ and $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{13}\\rm CO}>~=~0.37~\\pm~0.20~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ for the increased sample, which are in agreement with previously reported values. From virial analysis, we find that 80% of the GMC regions traced by resolved dust emission are bound and close to virial equilibrium. Finally, we update our analysis on the metallicity dependence of $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ by combining SMA observations with existing MMT/Hectospec optical spectroscopy toward H II regions. We find no trend in $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ with metallicity, supporting the previous findings."}

NGC 1097", "comment": "14 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\\sim$385 pc to $\\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales."}

Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures."}

Richie", "Evan Schneider"], "title": "Effects of Numerical Resolution on Simulated Cloud-Wind Interactions", "comment": "14 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism."}
