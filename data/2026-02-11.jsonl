However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \\(11.3\\%\\) throughput improvement for a \\(4\\times4\\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs."}

However, most existing approaches emphasize whole-brain age prediction and therefore overlook the pronounced regional heterogeneity of brain maturation that is crucial for detecting localized atypical trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose a novel spherical surface-based brain age prediction network (SurfAge-Net) that leverages multiple morphological metrics to capture region-specific developmental patterns with enhanced robustness and clinical interpretability. SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations. These results established fine-grained brain age prediction as a promising paradigm for advancing neurodevelopmental research and supporting early clinical assessment."}

This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate."}

In particular, we demonstrate that mmWave radar point cloud data can leak identity-related information in the absence of explicit identity labels. To address this risk, we propose {ImmCOGNITO}, a graph-based autoencoder that transforms radar gesture point clouds to preserve gesture-relevant structure while suppressing identity cues. The encoder first constructs a directed graph for each sequence using Temporal Graph KNN. Edges are defined to capture inter-frame temporal dynamics. A message-passing neural network with multi-head self-attention then aggregates local and global spatio-temporal context, and the global max-pooled feature is concatenated with the original features. The decoder then reconstructs a minimally perturbed point cloud that retains gesture discriminative attributes while achieving de-identification. Training jointly optimizes reconstruction, gesture-preservation, and de-identification objectives.

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries. The framework's efficacy was systematically validated using a public dataset across 20, 40, and 80 MHz bandwidth configurations. The model yielded accuracies of 89.27% (20 MHz), 94.13% (40 MHz), and 95.30% (80 MHz), respectively. These results confirm a marked superiority over standalone deep learning baselines, especially in the most constrained low-bandwidth scenarios.

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI."}

Using representational geometry as a mechanistic lens, we addressed this by tracking entropy, curvature, and fMRI encoding scores throughout Pythia (70M-1B) training. We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters. The low-complexity module, characterized by reduced entropy and curvature, consistently better predicted human language network activity. This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb). Crucially, reduced curvature remained a robust predictor of model-brain alignment even after controlling for training progress, an effect that strengthened with model scale. These results links training-driven geometric reorganization to temporal-frontal functional specialization, suggesting that representational smoothing facilitates neural-like linguistic processing."}

Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy.

A simulation framework implemented in Python was developed to evaluate these metrics using synthetic SHAP based feature attributions across multiple modality style configurations (brief, detailed, and analogy based).

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $α$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons."}

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling."}

We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses.

In this work, we examine this limitation from an information-based perspective using the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. We show that distance and expansion-rate data generically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, reflecting an irreducible loss of sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. This behavior can be traced directly to the integrated kernel structure of geometric observables. Growth measurements, by contrast, respond through differential dynamics and can introduce additional independent information directions. Using both controlled mock data and survey-like configurations representative of next-generation experiments, we find that the impact of growth information depends not only on its nominal precision but also on the structure of the data covariance. In simplified mock setups, growth measurements can partially activate a second information direction even at moderate precision. In Euclid-like configurations, however, the information remains effectively one-dimensional until growth precision reaches the percent level, below which a second mode emerges rapidly. These results clarify the complementary roles of distance and growth probes and provide a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy."}

In the uplink phase, the positioning signal is used to estimate channel parameters, which are subsequently used to determine the user's position. The spatial smoothing-multiple signal classification algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle-of-arrival, whereas an iterative interference cancellation scheme is conceived for the remaining parameters' estimation. The corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds of channel parameters and user position are also derived. During the downlink communication phase, the estimated parameters are exploited to improve beamforming at the base station. Simulation results evaluate the impact of ADC quantizer resolutions. Specifically, it is shown that enhanced downlink bit error rate performance can be achieved with improved uplink positioning, while the use of low-resolution ADCs induces noticeable performance degradation in the OTFS-IPAC system."}

This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs."}

ADCanvas combines conversational interaction with keyboard-based playback control and a plain-text, screen reader-accessible editor to support end-to-end AD authoring and visual question answering (VQA). Combining screen-reader-friendly controls with a multimodal LLM agent, ADCanvas supports live VQA, script generation, and AD modification. Through a user study with 12 BLV video creators, we find that users adopt the conversational agent as an informational aide and drafting assistant, while maintaining agency through verification and editing. For example, participants saw themselves as curators who received information from the model and filtered it down for their audience. Our findings offer design implications for accessible media tools, including precise editing controls, accessibility support for creative ideation, and configurable rules for human-AI collaboration."}

In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods.

During line tracing, the gaze typically leads the hand through predictive saccades, yet the extent to which this predictive window reflects expertise or intrinsic individual traits remains unclear. In this study, I examined eye-hand coordination in professional calligraphers and non-experts performing a controlled line tracing task. The temporal coupling between saccade distance (SD) and pen speed (PS) revealed substantial interpersonal variability: SD-PS peak times ranged from approximately -50 to 400 ms, forming stable, participant-specific predictive windows that were consistent across trials. These predictive windows closely matched each individual's pen catch-up time, indicating that the oculomotor system stabilizes fixation in anticipation of the hand's future velocity rather than relying on reactive pursuit. Neither the spatial indices (mean gaze-pen distance, mean saccade distance) nor the temporal index (SD-PS peak time) differed between calligraphers and non-calligraphers, and none of these predictive parameters correlated with tracing accuracy. These findings suggest that diverse predictive strategies can achieve equivalent performance, consistent with the minimum intervention principle of optimal feedback control. Together, the results indicate that predictive timing in eye-hand coordination reflects a stable, idiosyncratic Predictive Protocol shaped by individual neuromotor constraints rather than by expertise or training history."}

Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$Δβ$ plane, where $Δβ$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions."}

The resulting taxonomy included categories such as user prompts, explainability, user control, and users' mental models, with corresponding subcategories and example design features. In Phase 2, we ran a Wizard-of-Oz study with 20 participants, where a researcher acted as a web-based computer use agent and probed user reactions during normal, error-prone and risky execution. We used the findings to validate the taxonomy from Phase 1 and deepen our understand of the design space by identifying the connections between design areas and divergence in user needs and scenarios.

A total of 16 time-domain, frequency-domain, and memory-related features are used to provide a low-dimensional representation of bandwidth-induced pulse distortion. These features are mapped by a fully connected neural network to complex-valued matched filter coefficients, enabling adaptive pulse-shape compensation prior to symbol-rate sampling. The network is trained end-to-end using a differentiable loss function based on error vector magnitude (EVM). Experimental results obtained using a hardware-in-the-loop CAP transmission system demonstrate that the proposed deformable matched filter significantly outperforms conventional fixed matched filtering under severe bandwidth constraints, without requiring decision feedback or increasing receiver latency."}

We frame intelligence as flexible problem-solving, following William James, and develop the concept of \"cognitive light cones\" to characterize the continuum of intelligence in living systems and machines. We argue that biological evolution has discovered a scalable recipe for intelligence - and the progressive expansion of organisms' \"cognitive light cone\", predictive and control capacities. To explain how this is possible, we distill five design principles - multiscale autonomy, growth through self-assemblage of active components, continuous reconstruction of capabilities, exploitation of physical and embodied constraints, and pervasive signaling enabling self-organization and top-down control from goals - that underpin life's ability to navigate creatively diverse problem spaces. We discuss how these principles contrast with current AI paradigms and outline pathways for integrating them into future autonomous, embodied, and resilient artificial systems."}

Through 16 semi-structured interviews with drivers in the United States, we investigate the explanatory frameworks drivers construct to make sense of AI decisions, the strategies they employ when systems behave unexpectedly, and their experiences with control handoffs and feedback mechanisms. Our findings reveal that drivers develop sophisticated folk theories -- often using anthropomorphic metaphors describing systems that ``see,'' ``hesitate,'' or become ``overwhelmed'' -- yet lack informational resources to validate these theories or meaningfully participate in algorithmic governance. We identify contexts where algorithmic opacity manifests acutely, including complex intersections, adverse weather, and rural environments. Current AV designs position drivers as passive data sources rather than epistemic agents, creating accountability gaps that undermine trust and safety. Drawing on critical data studies and algorithmic accountability literature, we propose a framework for participatory algorithmic governance that would provide drivers with transparency into AI decision-making and meaningful channels for contributing to system improvement.

Modeling the reduced Hubble rate with a node-based Gaussian-process-kernel interpolant, we constrain the reconstruction using CC, Pantheon+ SNIa, BAO data from SDSS and DESI, transversal BAO data, and external $H_0$ priors (SH0ES and H0DN). Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $ρ_{\\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $ρ_{\\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\\dagger$ by $ρ_{\\rm DE}(z_\\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $ρ_{\\rm DE}>0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing. The reconstructed kinematics admit intermediate-redshift structure in some combinations, including hints of an additional accelerated-expansion interval around $z\\sim 1.7$--$2.3$. The present-day equation of state remains close to a cosmological constant: combinations including supernovae give $w_0\\simeq -1$, while combinations without supernovae but with an external $H_0$ prior show only a mild preference for $w_0<-1$ at the $\\sim1.5$--$1.7σ$ level."}

While scaling laws suggest improving performance by enlarging model capacity, practical edge deployments are fundamentally constrained by latency, energy, and memory, making unlimited model scaling infeasible. This creates a critical need to maximize the utility of limited inference-time inputs by filtering redundant observations and focusing on high-impact data. In large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI), context engineering has emerged as a key paradigm to guide inference by selectively structuring and injecting task-relevant information. Inspired by this success, we extend context engineering to wireless systems, providing a systematic way to enhance edge AI performance without increasing model complexity. In dynamic environments, for example, beam prediction can benefit from augmenting instantaneous channel measurements with contextual cues such as user mobility trends or environment-aware propagation priors. We formally introduce wireless context engineering and propose a Wireless Context Communication Framework (WCCF) to adaptively orchestrate wireless context under inference-time constraints. This work provides researchers with a foundational perspective and practical design dimensions to manage the wireless context of wireless edge intelligence. An ISAC-enabled beam prediction case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm under constrained sensing budgets."}

On the medical imaging side, functional magnetic resonance imaging has provided invaluable insights into the neural pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease.

In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods. We identify specific brain regions that are most predictive of cognitive impairment through experiments on data provided by the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, providing new insights into the neural substrates of early Alzheimer's pathology.

However, systematic uncertainties may hamper the exploration of the LSB universe by limiting detectable SB levels. Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this challenge and explore the LSB universe that we have yet to see, we have been developing a novel telescope called K-DRIFT. This paper outlines the telescope's specification and describes various LSB features we aim for, explicitly focusing on nearby individual galaxies.

To fill this gap, we present Compendia, an automated system that analyzes online articles in response to a user's query and generates a coherent data story tailored to the user's informational needs. Compendia addresses key challenges of storytelling from unstructured text through two modules covering: Online Article Retrieval, which gathers relevant articles; Data Fact Extraction, which identifies, validates, and refines quantitative facts; Fact Organization, which clusters and merges related facts into coherent thematic groups; and Visual Storytelling, which transforms the organized facts into narratives with visualizations in an interactive scrollytelling interface.

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics."}

While this structure theoretically enables accurate channel estimation by sampling the response from one pilot symbol, practical implementation is constrained by the spreading of effective channel response induced by pulse shaping filters. To address this, we first derive the I/O relationship for discrete-time oversampled Zak-OTFS, which closely approximates the continuous-time system and facilitates analysis and numerical simulation. We show that every delay-Doppler domain symbol undergoes the same effective channel response under the discrete oversampled Zak-OTFS. We then analyze the impact of window ambiguity functions, and reveal that high sidelobes lead to wide channel spreading and degrade estimation accuracy. Building on this insight, we propose a novel pulse shaping filter design that synthesizes Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) within the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm (IOTA) framework. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed design achieves superior channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional root-raised-cosine and rectangular windowing schemes in the high-SNR regime."}

Changes in perceived social norms, conformity, donation behavior, and user experience were measured pre- and postdiscussion. Results show that multi-agent interactions effectively increased perceived social norms and donation willingness. Notably, in-group agents led to stronger perceived social norms, higher conformity, and greater donation increases compared to out-group agents.

First, a signal propagation model is established based on geometric relationships, and a factor graph is constructed to represent the unknown parameters. The sum-product algorithm (SPA) is then applied to this factor graph to jointly estimate the multi-dimensional parameter vector.

Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cramér-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed R-BAL method can achieve a speedup of more than 10000$\\times$ over the conventional IPM in massive MIMO scenarios."}

This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $λ/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2π$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement."}

The Effect of Causal Priors on Data Visualization Interpretation", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding how individuals interpret charts is a crucial concern for visual data communication. This imperative has motivated a number of studies, including past work demonstrating that causal priors -- a priori beliefs about causal relationships between concepts -- can have significant influences on the perceived strength of variable relationships inferred from visualizations. This paper builds on these previous results, demonstrating that causal priors can also influence the types of patterns that people perceive as the most salient within ambiguous scatterplots that have roughly equal evidence for trend and cluster patterns. Using a mixed-design approach that combines a large-scale online experiment for breadth of findings with an in-person think-aloud study for analytical depth, we investigated how users' interpretations are influenced by the interplay between causal priors and the visualized data patterns. Our analysis suggests two archetypal reasoning behaviors through which people often make their observations: contextualization, in which users accept a visual pattern that aligns with causal priors and use their existing knowledge to enrich interpretation, and rationalization, in which users encounter a pattern that conflicts with causal priors and attempt to explain away the discrepancy by invoking external factors, such as positing confounding variables or data selection bias. These findings provide initial evidence highlighting the critical role of causal priors in shaping high-level visualization comprehension, and introduce a vocabulary for describing how users reason about data that either confirms or challenges prior beliefs of causality."}

We present the Local Damage Mode Extractor (LDME), a structured, physics-informed signal processing framework that combines dual-path denoising, multiscale decomposition, fractional-domain enhancement, and statistically principled anomaly scoring to produce interpretable condition indicators without supervision. LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector. Evaluation using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the HUMS 2023 planetary gearbox benchmark, and a controlled simulated dataset shows that LDME consistently distinguishes nominal, early-crack, and propagated-crack stages under various operating conditions. LDME identifies the primary detection event earlier (198 cycles) than HT-TSA (284 cycles) and advances maintenance recommendation time from 383 to 365 cycles. We discuss its relation to prior art, limitations, and future theoretical directions. All code and experimental configurations are documented for reproducibility."}

Our results show that mass accretion via TDEs peaks within the first 2 Myr and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with roughly half the disrupted stellar debris being accreted. Compact object accretion is confined mostly to orbits with pericenters between 4 and 27 Schwarzschild radii and is suppressed by an order of magnitude when inspiral criteria are applied."}

However, many rich visual features remain inaccessible through touch alone, making it difficult to distinguish similar objects, interpret visual affordances, and form a complete understanding of objects. In this work, we present TouchScribe, a system that augments hand-object interactions with automated live visual descriptions. We trained a custom egocentric hand interaction model to recognize both common gestures (e.g., grab to inspect, hold side-by-side to compare) and unique ones by blind people (e.g., point to explore color, or swipe to read available texts). Furthermore, TouchScribe provides real-time and adaptive feedback based on hand movement, from hand interaction states, to object labels, and to visual details. Our user study and technical evaluations demonstrate that TouchScribe can provide rich and useful descriptions to support object understanding. Finally, we discuss the implications of making live visual descriptions responsive to users' physical reach."}

In practical deployments, CKM observations are often noisy and irregular due to coverage-induced sparsity and hardware-induced linear/nonlinear degradations. Conventional end-to-end algorithms couple CKM prior information with task- and device-specific observations, and require labeled data and separate training for each construction configuration, which is expensive and therefore incompatible with scalable edge deployments. Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations. A foundation model is trained once in the cloud using unlabeled data to learn a generalizable CKM prior. During inference, edge nodes combine the shared prior with local observations. Experiments on the CKMImageNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves competitive construction accuracy while substantially reducing training cost and data requirements, mitigating negative transfer, and offering clear advantages in generalization and deployment scalability."}

However, the legacy 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model faces critical validity challenges when applied to 6G FR3, stemming from both the distinct propagation characteristics of this frequency band and the fundamental physical paradigm shift induced by ELAA. In response, 3GPP Release 19 (Rel-19) has validated the model through extensive new measurements and introduced significant enhancements. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to the Rel-19 channel model for 6G FR3, bridging the gap between standardization specifications and practical simulation implementation. First, we provide a high-level overview of the fundamental principles of the 3GPP channel modeling framework. Second, we detail the specific enhancements and modifications introduced in Rel-19, including the rationale behind the new Suburban Macro (SMa) scenario, the mathematical modeling of ELAA-driven features such as near-field and spatial non-stationarity, and the recalibration of large-scale parameters.

We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium."}

In this work, we propose a joint framework for simplicial complex learning that enforces the inclusion property through a linear constraint, enabling the formulation of the problem as a binary linear program. The objective function consists of a combination of smoothness measures across all considered simplicial levels, allowing for the incorporation of arbitrary smoothness criteria. This formulation enables the simultaneous estimation of edges and higher-order simplices within a single optimization problem.

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

In this paper, we propose a two-stage cluster-then-predict framework for multiple load values prediction task in multiport scatterers. The proposed cluster-then-predict approach effectively captures the underlying functional relation between S-parameters and corresponding load impedances, achieving up to a 46% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the baseline when applied to gradient boosting (GB). This improvement is consistent across various clustering and regression methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Real-world Unified Index (RUI), a metric for quantitative analysis of trade-offs among multiple metrics with conflicting objectives and different scales, suitable for performance assessment in realistic scenarios. Based on RUI, the combination of K-means clustering and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is identified as the optimal setup for the analyzed multiport scatterer."}

This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+)."}

Rivalry is primarily associated with relational crafting and skill maintenance. Collaboration is primarily associated with task crafting, productivity, and satisfaction, at the cost of long-term skill deterioration. Combination of the orientations (high rivalry and high collaboration) reconciles these differences, while boosting the association with the outcomes. Our findings argue for a balanced approach where high levels of rivalry and collaboration are essential to shape work practices and generate outcomes aimed at the long-term success of the job.

To address this gap, we conducted a series of studies with BIF individuals and caretakers to comprehensively understand their VBL challenges. Our analysis revealed challenges stemming from misalignment between user cognitive characteristics and video elements (e.g., overwhelmed by pacing and density, difficulty inferring omitted content), and experiential factors intensifying challenges (e.g., low self-efficacy).

LocDreamer learns a WM that captures the latent representation of the target motion and localization environment, thereby generating synthetic measurements to imagine arbitrary anchor deployments. These measurements enable imagination-driven training of both the tracking model and the reinforcement learning (RL)-based anchor scheduler that activates only the most informative anchors, which significantly reduce energy and signaling costs while preserving high tracking accuracy.

Well-designed MCQs should evaluate knowledge application in real-world situations. However, writing such test items in sufficient numbers is challenging and time-consuming, especially in natural science education. The problem of a sufficient number of MCQs has two aspects: content coverage and exam security. Therefore, generating test items involves two tasks: creating MCQ prototypes and transforming these prototypes into item series. In automated item generation, prototype creation aligns with template-based methods like cognitive modelling, while item expansion corresponds to example-based techniques. The aim of this research was designing the goal-oriented conceptual model of human - AI co-creation of MCQs that should meet strictly formulated quality criteria. The resulting three-step model for creating MCQ prototypes distributed prompts between several AIs, with human revision of responses for each prompt before setting the next one. To transform the MCQ prototype into an MCQ series, a one-step model was developed in which multiple new items are generated simultaneously. These items assess the same learning outcome but are not simple rephrasings of the prototype or of one another. Based on human and automated evaluation, approximately half of the output MCQs were acceptable without editing. Minor corrections of initially rejected test items allowed for a moderate increase in acceptance of MCQs in series and a significant improvement of MCQ-prototypes."}

Conventional Euclidean-space methods rely on approximations or relaxations, which degrade performance and incur substantial computational costs. Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) offers a powerful alternative that directly operates on the manifold defined by the geometric constraints. This approach inherently satisfies the constraints at every optimization step, thereby avoiding the performance degradation and substantial computational costs. In this paper, we first elaborate on the principles of RMO, including the fundamental concepts, tools, and methods, emphasizing its effectiveness for nonconvex problems. We then introduce its applications in advanced wireless communications, showing how constrained problems are reformulated on their natural manifolds and solved using tailored RMO algorithms.

We begin by modeling the entire communication process from the encoder output to the decoder input, encompassing the physical channel and all transceiver operations, as the SF channel, thereby establishing an encoder-SF channel-decoder pipeline. In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a joint optimization framework for the encoder-decoder and SF channel, applicable to both analog and digital SCs. To realize the optimized SF channel, we also propose a physical-layer calibration strategy that enables real-time power control and adaptation to varying channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SF channel optimization achieves superior task performance under various communication environments."}

In this work, we propose augmenting the upper confidence bound (UCB) based MAB with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to address this limitation. The premise of the work is that the radar and communication functionalities share the same field-of-view and that communication mobile users are detected by the radar as mobile targets. The radar information is used for significantly reducing the number of candidate beams for the UCB, resulting in an overall reduction in the exploration time. Further, the radar information is used to estimate the realignment time in quasi-stationary scenarios. We have realized the MAB and radar signal processing algorithms on the system on chip (SoC) via hardware-software co-design (HSCD) and fixed-point analysis. We demonstrate the significant gain in execution time using accelerators. The simulations consider complex propagation channels involving direct and multipath, with simple and extended radar targets in the presence of significant static clutter. The resulting experiments show that the proposed ISAC-based MAB achieves a 35% reduction in the overall exploration time and 1.4 factor higher throughput as compared to the conventional MAB that is based only on communications."}

However, structured beam schemes based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) fail to fully exploit the array aperture, thereby limiting their topological reconfigurability and adaptability to diverse communication scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications."}

This paper challenges that assumption by examining the technosocial risks posed by ideal ERTs, understood as multimodal systems capable of reliably inferring inner affective states in real time. Drawing on philosophical accounts of emotional expression and social practice, as well as empirical work in affective science and social psychology, I argue that the appeal of such systems rests on a misunderstanding of the social functions of emotional expression. Emotional expressions function not only as read-outs of inner states, but also as tools for coordinating action, enabling moral repair, sustaining interpersonal trust, and supporting collective norms. These functions depend on a background of partial opacity and epistemic friction. When deployed in socially authoritative or evaluative contexts, ideal ERTs threaten this expressive space by collapsing epistemic friction, displacing relational meaning with technology-mediated affective profiles, and narrowing the space for aspirational and role-sensitive expressions. The result is a drift towards affective determinism and ambient forms of affective auditing, which undermine both social cohesion and individual agency. I argue that, although it is intuitive to think that increasing accuracy would legitimise such systems, in the case of ERTs accuracy does not straightforwardly justify their deployment, and may, in some contexts, provide a reason for regulatory restraint. I conclude by defending a function-first regulatory approach that treats expressive discretion and intentional emotional expression as constitutive of certain social goods, and that accordingly seeks to protect these goods from excessive affective legibility."}

The objective of the radar is to first scan the angular search space and detect and localize mobile users/targets in the presence of discrete clutter scatterers. Subsequently, this information is used to direct highly directional beams toward these mobile users for communication service. The choice of radar parameters such as the radar duty cycle and the corresponding beamwidth are critical for realizing high communication throughput. In this work, we use the stochastic geometry-based mathematical framework to analyze the radar operating metrics as a function of diverse radar, target, and clutter parameters and subsequently use these results to study the network throughput of the ISAC system.

Preprint of an accepted IUI '26 paper", "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) image tools are increasingly used in design practice, enabling rapid ideation but offering limited support for refinement tasks such as adjusting layout, scale, or visual attributes. While text prompts and inpainting allow localized edits, they often remain inefficient or ambiguous for precise, in-context, and iterative refinement -- motivating the exploration of alternative methods. This work examines how pen-based scribbles and annotations can enhance GenAI image refinement. A formative study with seven professional designers informed a prototype supporting three input modalities: text-only, visual-only, and combined prompting. A within-subjects study with 30 designers and design students compared these modalities across closed- and open-ended tasks, evaluating expressiveness, efficiency, workload, user experience, iteration, and multimodal strategies. Visual prompts improved clarity and speed for spatial edits while reducing workload, whereas text remained effective for semantic and global changes. The combined modality received the highest overall ratings, enabling complementary use, balancing spatial precision with semantic detail, and supporting smoother iteration. Task-specific preferences also emerged: adding new objects often required both modalities, while moving or modifying elements was typically handled through visual input. This work contributes (1) an empirical comparison of multimodal prompting for GenAI refinement, (2) a prototype integrating scribbles and annotations, and (3) insights into designers' multimodal strategies to inform future GenAI interfaces that better support refinement in GenAI-supported design workflows."}

The proposed DNS uses a recurrent architecture that helps to provide a closed-form posterior of the hidden state sequence given the measurement sequence. DNS learns in an unsupervised manner, meaning the training dataset consists of only measurement data and no state data. We demonstrate DNS using simulations for smoothing of several stochastic dynamical processes, including a benchmark Lorenz system. Experimental results show that the DNS is significantly better than a deep Kalman smoother (DKS) and an iterative data-driven nonlinear state estimation (iDANSE) smoother."}

Next, the DS and GRS signals are emulated by the output from two ports of the Keysight Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and interfaced with the RFSoC where the signals are subsequently processed to obtain the delay-Doppler maps. The performance is validated for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)."}

We investigate how communication strategies evolve through repeated collaboration as people coordinate on shared procedural abstractions. To this end, we conducted an online unimodal study (n = 98) using natural language to probe abstraction hierarchies. In a follow-up lab study (n = 40), we examined how multimodal communication (speech and gestures) changed during physical collaboration. Pairs used augmented reality to isolate their partner's hand and voice; one participant viewed a 3D virtual tower and sent instructions to the other, who built the physical tower. Participants became faster and more accurate by establishing linguistic and gestural abstractions and using cross-modal redundancy to emphasize key changes from previous interactions. Based on these findings, we extend probabilistic models of convention formation to multimodal settings, capturing shifts in modality preferences. Our findings and model provide building blocks for designing convention-aware intelligent agents situated in the physical world."}

Nevertheless, SemComs rely heavily on the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) at the transceivers, which limit the accuracy between the original and reconstructed data and are challenging to implement in practice due to increased architecture complexity. Thus, hybrid cellular networks that utilize both conventional bit communications (BitComs) and SemComs have been introduced to bridge the gap between required and existing infrastructure. To facilitate such networks, in this work, we investigate reliability by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the network. Additionally, we propose a generalized outage probability through which the cell radius that achieves a desired outage threshold for a specific range of users is calculated in closed form. Additionally, to consider the practical limitations caused by the specialized dedicated hardware and the increased memory and computational resources that are required to support SemCom, a semantic utilization metric is proposed. Based on this metric, we express the probability that a specific number of users select SemCom transmission and calculate the optimal cell radius for that number in closed form. Simulation results validate the derived analytical expressions and the characterized design properties of the cell radius found through the proposed metrics, providing useful insights."}

However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions."}

While existing authentication mechanisms are available for interaction-rich devices such as smartwatches, enabling on-device authentication (ODA) on interaction-limited wearables including rings, earphones, glasses, and wristbands remains difficult. Moreover, as users increasingly own multiple smart devices, relying on device-specific authentication methods becomes redundant and burdensome. To address these challenges, we present PPGTransID, a ubiquitous and unobtrusive cross-device authentication (CDA) approach that leverages the real-time physiological consistency of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals across the human body. PPGTransID utilizes widely available PPG sensors on wearable devices to capture users' physiological signals and compares them with remote PPG (rPPG) signals extracted from a smartphone camera, where robust face-based authentication is already established. In doing so, PPGTransID securely transfers the reliable authentication status of the smartphone to nearby wearable devices without requiring additional user interaction. An evaluation with 33 participants shows that PPGTransID achieves a balanced accuracy of 95.5 percent and generalizes across multiple wearable form factors. Robustness experiments with 10 participants demonstrate resilience to variations in lighting, camera placement, and user behavior, while a real-time usability study with 14 participants confirms reliable performance with minimal interaction burden."}

This process is typically implemented by an interdisciplinary team of nurses, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals.

In this study, we developed a patient-centered virtual reality (VR) exergame through an interdisciplinary design process involving clinicians and therapists, tailored to the constraints of critical care. The exergame incorporates progressive mobility levels that mirror early mobilization practices, and includes an embodied avatar to provide guidance and motivation. Using Meta Quest 3 body tracking, the system captures and visualizes patients' movements, thereby providing motivational engagement and quantifiable mobility metrics. We evaluated the exergame in two stages: a dual-user study involving healthy participants and healthcare professionals or students (N = 13), and a subsequent study with cardiothoracic ICU patients (N = 18) to assess feasibility, design validity, and clinical acceptance. Across both studies, participants reported high enjoyment and engagement without discomfort or stress. Furthermore, patients demonstrated increases in movement speed, range of motion, and workspace volume of the upper body across game levels. Physiological monitoring further indicated that the exergame elicited exertion without inducing excessive cardiovascular responses. These findings highlight the feasibility of VR exergames as a clinically acceptable and engaging adjunct to early mobilization in critical care, offering a novel pathway to improve rehabilitation outcomes for ICU patients."}

During line tracing, the gaze typically leads the hand through predictive saccades, yet the extent to which this predictive window reflects expertise or intrinsic individual traits remains unclear. In this study, I examined eye-hand coordination in professional calligraphers and non-experts performing a controlled line tracing task. The temporal coupling between saccade distance (SD) and pen speed (PS) revealed substantial interpersonal variability: SD-PS peak times ranged from approximately -50 to 400 ms, forming stable, participant-specific predictive windows that were consistent across trials. These predictive windows closely matched each individual's pen catch-up time, indicating that the oculomotor system stabilizes fixation in anticipation of the hand's future velocity rather than relying on reactive pursuit. Neither the spatial indices (mean gaze-pen distance, mean saccade distance) nor the temporal index (SD-PS peak time) differed between calligraphers and non-calligraphers, and none of these predictive parameters correlated with tracing accuracy. These findings suggest that diverse predictive strategies can achieve equivalent performance, consistent with the minimum intervention principle of optimal feedback control. Together, the results indicate that predictive timing in eye-hand coordination reflects a stable, idiosyncratic Predictive Protocol shaped by individual neuromotor constraints rather than by expertise or training history."}
