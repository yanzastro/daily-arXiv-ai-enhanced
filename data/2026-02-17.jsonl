Joint activities are made possible by the coordination of plans for action, and the coordination of plans for action is made possible by the capacity for collective intentionality. This paper investigates how primitive is the capacity that nonhuman animals have to create social entities, by individuating how primitive is the capacity for collective intentionality. I present a novel argument for the evolutionary primitiveness of social entities, by showing that the collective intentions upon which these social entities are created and shared are metaphysically reducible to the relevant individual intentions."}

One potential signature of such a violation is cosmic birefringence - rotation of the polarization plane of photons due to Chern-Simons coupling in Maxwell's electrodynamics. This rotation angle, aka birefringence angle, depends upon the distance travelled by the photon and is thus different for CMB and 21cm photons. While the rotation angle in CMB, i.e., $α_\\mathrm{CMB}$, has been tightly constrained by CMB experiments, the potential of the 21cm cosmological signal to constrain this parameter, as well as constrain $α_\\mathrm{21cm}$, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we provide constraints on both these angles by cross-correlating 21cm and CMB signals. Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we give our forecasts for 21cm experiments, including SKA, HIRAX, and PUMA, and Planck like CMB experiment. We find that best constraints $σ_{α_\\mathrm{CMB}} \\sim 4.4^\\circ$ and $σ_{α_\\mathrm{21cm}} \\sim 100^\\circ$ are found using $C_\\ell^{T_{21} B_\\mathrm{CMB}}$ and $C_\\ell^{T_{21} B_{21}}$ respectively. Since birefringence hasn't yet been detected in 21cm, we choose the fiducial value $α_\\mathrm{21cm}^\\mathrm{fid}=0$ assuming the null hypothesis."}

Yet despite their frequency, the role of pilot studies in HCI remains conceptually vague and empirically underexamined. Unlike fields such as medicine, nursing, and education, where pilot and feasibility studies have well-established definitions, guidelines, reporting standards and even a dedicated research journal, the CHI community lacks a shared understanding of what constitutes a pilot study, why they are conducted, and how they should be reported.

However, these models remain degenerate, often calibrated primarily to match observed stellar masses. To explore these degeneracies, we conduct three state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations of the same galaxy, each incorporating different subgrid models: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We compare their circumgalactic media (CGM) through quasar absorption sightlines of HI, MgII, CIV, and OVI. Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with the same stellar masses, the models lead to distinct feedback modes and CGM properties. Column densities and covering fractions serve as effective diagnostics of subgrid models, with all four ions providing strong constraints as they trace diverse gas phases, exhibit complementary spatial distributions, and originate from different mechanisms. Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them. The simulation including mechanical feedback reproduces the observed CIV covering fractions well, whereas the other models show slight offsets. We argue that this discrepancy is likely driven by unresolved thermal structures for HI and MgII, and insufficient metals for CIV and OVI, arising from missing physics such as AGNs or cosmic rays."}

We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $μ\\simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \\pm 0.7$, $3.5 \\pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \\pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \\pm 2.6$, $13.0 \\pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \\pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$.

However, the large XL-IRS aperture induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and high complexity, especially in uniform planar array (UPA) systems. To address these issues, we first propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This structure leverages spatial characteristics, enabling independent estimation of factor matrices to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor matrices are spanned by BS and NF IRS array responses. We then formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal log-sum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the method is accelerated via higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with majorization-minimization and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound and conduct convergence analysis. Simulations show the proposed scheme achieves a 13.6 dB improvement in normalized mean square error over benchmarks with significantly reduced runtime."}

Previous studies examined factors that facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients in socially marginalized communities, especially developing countries, and applied identified factors to technology development. However, there is limited understanding of how providers work with patients from immigrant populations in a developed country. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 15 providers working with patients from an immigrant community with unique cultural characteristics, we identified providers' effective communication strategies, including acknowledgment, community involvement, gradual care, and adaptive communication practices (i.e., adjusting the communication style). Based on our findings, we highlight cultural competence and discuss design implications for technologies to support health communication in immigrant communities.

Moreover, privacy concerns and low lighting conditions limit the use of cameras in long-term care (LTC) facilities. This paper proposes a lightweight, non-visual image-based method for robust quasi-static human presence detection using a low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. On a dataset covering five semi-static activities, the proposed method improves average detection accuracy from 68.3% for Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and 78.8% for Order-Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) to 93.24% for Subject 1, from 51.3%, 68.3% to 92.3% for Subject 2, and 57.72%, 69.94% to 94.82% for Subject 3, respectively. Finally, we benchmarked all three detectors across all activities on a Raspberry Pi 4B using a shared Range-Angle (RA) preprocessing pipeline. The proposed algorithm obtains an average 8.2 ms per frame, resulting in over 120 frames per second (FPS) and a 74 times speed-up over OS-CFAR. These results demonstrate that simple image-based processing can provide robust and deployable quasi-static human sensing in cluttered indoor environments."}

From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant."}

In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential.

This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m. These results demonstrate that, despite its lower resolution, RSSI can support practical passive sensing and offers a low-cost alternative to CSI-based WiFi sensing."}

To test our model, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,256) on a financial decision-support system implementing different anthropomorphic designs. We found that anthropomorphism indirectly reduces risk perception by increasing both cognitive and affective trust. Domain knowledge moderates these paths: participants with low financial knowledge experience a negative indirect effect of perceived anthropomorphism on risk perception via cognitive trust, whereas those with high financial knowledge exhibit a positive direct and indirect effect. We discuss theoretical contributions to human-AI interaction and design implications for calibrating trust in anthropomorphic decision-support systems for responsible AI."}

We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region."}

Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature."}

Among these approaches, vector quantization (VQ)-based JSCC effectively maps high-dimensional semantic feature vectors into compact codeword indices for digital modulation. However, existing methods, including universal JSCC (uJSCC), rely on fixed, modulation-specific encoders, decoders, and codebooks, limiting adaptability to fine-grained SNR variations. We propose an extended universal JSCC (euJSCC) framework that achieves SNR- and modulation-adaptive transmission within a single model. euJSCC employs a hypernetwork-based normalization layer for fine-grained feature vector normalization and a dynamic codebook generation (DCG) network that refines modulation-specific base codebooks according to block-wise SNR. To handle block fading channels, which consist of multiple coherence blocks, an inner-outer encoder-decoder architecture is adopted, where the outer encoder and decoder capture long-term channel statistics, and the inner encoder and decoder refine feature vectors to align with block-wise codebooks.

This study examines students perceptions of these tools, focusing on usability, efficiency, and their integration into English language test preparation workflows.Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 140 university students from diverse academic disciplines and conducted in-depth interviews with 20 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to evaluate differences in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and overall tool preference. The qualitative findings indicate that students frequently switch between GPT and Google depending on task demands, relying on Google for credible, multi-source information and rule verification, while using GPT for summarization, explanation, paraphrasing, and drafting responses for English test tasks. As neither tool alone was found to adequately support all aspects of English language test problem solving, participants expressed a strong preference for a hybrid solution. In response, we propose a prototype in the form of a chatbot embedded within a search interface, combining GPTs conversational strengths with Google reliability to improve English language test preparation and reduce cognitive load."}

From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $ρ\\propto r^{-γ}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $γ= γ_0 + γ_z \\cdot z_l + γ_s \\cdot \\log \\tildeΣ$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\\tildeΣ$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $Λ$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $γ_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $γ_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $γ_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $γ$ increases with surface mass density ($γ_s > 0$) and decreases with redshift ($γ_z < 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing--dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy--galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure."}

We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \\sim 10^{-3}$.

This curvature breaks the Fourier/Vandermonde structure behind classical subspace methods, and it is especially limiting with hybrid front-ends that provide only a small number of pilot measurements. Consequently, practical systems need continuous angle resolution and joint angle-range inference where many near-field approaches still rely on costly 2D gridding. We show that convexity can meet curvature via a lifted, gridless superresolution framework for near-field measurements. The key is a Bessel-Vandermonde factorization of the Fresnel-phase manifold that exposes a hidden Vandermonde structure in angle while isolating the range dependence into a compact coefficient map. Building on this, we introduce a lifting that maps each range bin and continuous angle to a structured rank-one atom, converting the nonlinear near-field model into a linear inverse problem over a row-sparse matrix. Recovery is posed as atomic-norm minimization and an explicit dual characterization via bounded trigonometric polynomials yields certificate-based localization that super-resolves off-grid angles and identifies active range bins. Simulations with strongly undersampled hybrid observations validate reliable joint angle-range recovery for next-generation wireless and ISAC systems."}

This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes."}

Submitted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Cold atomic and molecular gas are commonly observed in the winds of both external galaxies and the Milky Way, yet the survival and origin of these cool phases within hot galactic winds is poorly understood. To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought."}

Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem.

Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve \"test particles\" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields."}

By treating the wireless propagation environment and network elements as differentiable operators, new opportunities arise for joint communication-computation designs, where system optimization can be achieved through learning-based methods applied directly to the physical network. This approach may operate independently of, or in conjunction with, conventional digital neural layers, enabling hybrid communication learning pipelines. In the article, we outline representative architectures that embody this viewpoint and discuss the algorithmic and training considerations required to leverage the wireless medium as a computational resource. Through numerical examples, we highlight the potential performance gains in processing, adaptability, efficiency, and end-to-end optimization, demonstrating the promise of reconfiguring wireless systems as learning networks in next-generation communication frameworks."}

These interfaces and their content support human interaction with AI-assisted decision-making and communication processes and should remain accessible and usable for people with disabilities. Accessible plain-language interfaces serve as an enabling infrastructure for meaningful human oversight. In these contexts, ethical and trustworthiness risks, including hallucinations, semantic distortion, bias, and accessibility barriers, can undermine reliability and limit users' ability to understand, monitor, and intervene in AI-supported processes. Yet, in practice, oversight is often treated as a downstream check, without clear rules for when human intervention is required or who is accountable. We propose oversight-by-design: embedding human judgment across the pipeline as an architectural commitment, implemented via escalation policies and explicit UI controls for risk signalling and intervention. Automated checks flag risk in generated UI communication that supports high-stakes workflows (e.g., readability, semantic fidelity, factual consistency, and standards-based accessibility constraints) and escalate to mandatory Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) review before release when thresholds are violated, or uncertainty is high. Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) supervision monitors system-level signals over time (alerts, escalation rates, and compliance evidence) to tune policies and detect drift. Structured review feedback is translated into governance actions (rule and prompt updates, threshold calibration, and traceable audit logs), enabling scalable intervention and verifiable oversight for generative UI systems that support high-stakes workflows."}

The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis."}

In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $ω$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\\rm act}) \\ln (ν_{0}/ω)$ with $T_{\\rm act}$ activation temperature and $ν_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $χ_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm max}(ω)$ at $N_{\\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $ν_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments."}

In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history."}

Even this rather simple system provides a rich set of constraints with which to explore the accretion history and gravitational potential of an otherwise unremarkable late-type galaxy. Given the depth of the LIGHTS images, this system is an example of the types of stellar stream that could be found in a majority of nearby giant galaxies with the 10-year stack of Rubin/LSST data."}

A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak.

A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ with $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations.

It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era.

A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases. Simulation results show that the proposed SAC method achieves up to 28% and 16% secrecy energy efficiency gains over SCA and deep deterministic policy gradient baselines, respectively, while demonstrating superior robustness to CSI uncertainty and stable performance across varying transmit power levels and RIS sizes."}

This exploratory mixed-method study examines why mothers are moving from Facebook parenting groups to large language models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 109 mothers. Results show that 41.3% of participants avoided Facebook parenting groups because they expected judgment from others. This difference was statistically significant across location and family structure. Mothers living in their home country and those in joint families were more likely to avoid Facebook groups. Qualitative findings revealed three themes: social judgment and exposure, LLMs as safe and private spaces, and quick and structured support. Participants described LLMs as immediate, emotionally safe, and reliable alternatives that reduce social risk when asking for help. Rather than replacing human support, LLMs appear to fill emotional and practical gaps within existing support systems. These findings show a change in maternal digital support and highlight the need to design LLM systems that support both information and emotional safety."}

Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups."}

We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $Ω_{\\rm GW} h^2\\lesssim 2\\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $Ω_{\\rm GW}h^2\\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}\\lesssim H_* \\lesssim \\mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field."}

However, deploying high-resolution quantizers in large-scale mMIMO arrays, along with numerous IRS elements, leads to substantial hardware complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. This leads to a highly non-convex fractional secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, two algorithms are proposed: (1) the WMMSE-PDD algorithm, which reformulates the SRM problem into a sequence of non-fractional programs with auxiliary variables using the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and solves them via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach, achieving superior secrecy performance; and (2) the exact penalty product Riemannian gradient descent (EPPRGD) algorithm, which transforms the SRM problem into an unconstrained optimization over a product Riemannian manifold, eliminating auxiliary variables and enabling faster convergence with a slight trade-off in secrecy performance. Both algorithms provide analytical solutions at each iteration and are proven to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods and highlight their respective advantages."}

Within this network, Guardians ad Litem (GALs) play a unique role as court-appointed advocates tasked with ensuring the best interests of youth. Yet little is known about how GALs perceive and support youths' online safety. To address this gap, we conducted a two-part workshop with 10 GALs to explore their perspectives on online safety and collaboratively envision technology-based solutions tailored to the needs of youth in the CWS. Our findings revealed that GALs struggle to support youth with online safety challenges due to limited digital literacy, inconsistency of institutional support, lack of collaboration among stakeholders, and complexity of family dynamics. While GALs recognized the need for some oversight of youth online activities, they emphasized designing systems that support online safety beyond control or restriction by fostering stability, trust, and meaningful interactions, both online and offline. GALs emphasized the importance of developing tools that enable ongoing communication, therapeutic support, and coordination across stakeholders. Proposed design concepts focused on strengthening youth agency and cross-stakeholder collaboration through virtual avatars and mobile apps. This work provides actionable design concepts for strengthening relationships and communication across care network.

The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete.

We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe."}

Each request involves milestones where the agent must decide whether to keep assisting the customer or to transfer them to a more skilled -- and often costlier -- provider. To understand how this request resolution process should be managed, we develop a model in which each channel is represented as a gatekeeper system and characterize the structure of the optimal request resolution policy. We then turn to the broader question of the firm's customer service design, which includes the strategic problem of which channels to deploy, the tactical questions of at what level to staff the live-agent channel and to what extent to train an AI chatbot, and the operational question of how to control the live-agent channel.

Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found. These findings provide observational evidence that tidal perturbations in major mergers play a key role in regulating bar evolution."}

In 28 semi-structured interviews with scriptwriters and writers specialized in micro-dramas, we found that the short-turn-around workflow leads to writers taking on multiple roles simultaneously, iteratively adapting to storylines in response to real-time audience feedback in the form of comments, reposts, and memes. We identified unique narrative styles such as AI-generated micro-dramas and audience-responsive micro-dramas. This work reveals audience interaction as a new paradigm for collaborative creative processes on social media."}

The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \\pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1.\n  Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking."}

To address this challenge, we propose DALL, a text labeling framework that integrates data programming, active learning, and large language models. DALL introduces a structured specification that allows users and large language models to define labeling functions via configuration, rather than code. Active learning identifies informative instances for review, and the large language model analyzes these instances to help users correct labels and to refine or suggest labeling functions. We implement DALL as an interactive labeling system for text labeling tasks. Comparative, ablation, and usability studies demonstrate DALL's efficiency, the effectiveness of its modules, and its usability."}

We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $μ\\simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \\pm 0.7$, $3.5 \\pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \\pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \\pm 2.6$, $13.0 \\pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \\pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \\simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography."}

This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification."}

The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies."}

Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases."}

Contextual understanding is essential for supporting embodied creativity. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are fundamentally limited, however, by their reliance on disembodied data. We propose Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, to bridge the epistemological gap between human and machine, and promote creative exploration. It is a pragmatic, action-oriented solution to guide the system, repurposing XAI methods such as the Rashomon Technique. This facilitates exploring a spectrum of creative possibilities, and the exchange of 'perspectives' between human and machine. Using Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, we can reintroduce productive friction and support human agency in human-machine creative collaborations."}

Players could not reliably identify the level's creator, yet their experiences were strongly linked to their beliefs about that creator rather than the actual truth. Levels believed to be human-made were rated as more fun and aesthetically pleasing. In contrast, those believed to be AI-generated were rated as more frustrating and challenging.

However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge.

Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks."}

The uncertainty in the environment, particularly how diagnostic evidence is distributed, causes complexities in information search, further leading to suboptimal decision-making outcomes. Yet AI decision support often targets outcome optimization, and less is known about how to scaffold search without increasing cognitive load. We introduce SERA, an LLM-based assistant that provides either gist or verbatim feedback during search. Across two experiments (N1=54, N2=54), we examined decision-making outcomes and information search in SERA-Gist, SERA-Verbatim, and a no-feedback baseline across three environments varying in uncertainty. The uncertainty in environment is operationalized by the perceived gain of information across the course of sampling, which individuals may experience diminishing return of information gain (decremental; low-uncertainty), or a local drop of information gain (local optimum; medium-uncertainty), or no patterns in information gain (high-uncertainty), as they search more. Individuals show more accurate decision outcomes and are more confident with SERA support, especially under higher uncertainty. Gist feedback was associated with more efficient integration and showed a descriptive pattern of reduced oversampling, while verbatim feedback promoted more extensive exploration. These findings establish feedback representation as a design lever when search matters, motivating adaptive systems that match feedback granularity to uncertainty."}

Submitted to EDM 2026 (Mining track)", "summary": "Peer learning, where learners teach and learn from each other, is foundational to educational practice. A novel phenomenon has emerged: AI agents forming communities where they teach each other skills, share discoveries, and collaboratively build knowledge. This paper presents an educational data mining analysis of Moltbook, a large-scale community where over 2.4 million AI agents engage in peer learning, posting tutorials, answering questions, and sharing newly acquired skills. Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments."}

This study examines 2.8 million tweets containing #LongCOVID to understand how contested illness communities construct knowledge networks and respond to epistemic injustice. Through topic modeling, reflexive thematic analysis, and exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), we identify seven discourse themes spanning symptom documentation, medical dismissal, cross-illness solidarity, and policy advocacy. Our analysis reveals a differentiated ecosystem of user roles -- including patient advocates, research coordinators, and citizen scientists -- who collectively challenge medical gatekeeping while building connections to established ME/CFS advocacy networks. ERGM results demonstrate that tie formation centers on epistemic practices: users discussing knowledge sharing and community building formed significantly more network connections than those focused on policy debates, supporting characterization of this space as an epistemic community. Long COVID patients experienced medical gaslighting patterns documented across contested illnesses, yet achieved WHO recognition within months -- contrasting sharply with decades-long struggles of similar conditions. These findings illuminate how social media affordances enable marginalized patient populations to rapidly construct alternative knowledge systems, form cross-illness coalitions, and contest traditional medical authority structures."}

While prior patient-centered studies have examined the capabilities and experience of LLM-based tools in specific health-related tasks such as information-seeking, diagnosis, or decision-supporting, the inherently longitudinal nature of healthcare in real-world practice has been underexplored. This paper presents a four-week diary study with 25 patients to examine LLMs' roles across healthcare-seeking trajectories. Our analysis reveals that patients integrate LLMs not just as simple decision-support tools, but as dynamic companions that scaffold their journey across behavioral, informational, emotional, and cognitive levels. Meanwhile, patients actively assign diverse socio-technical meanings to LLMs, altering the traditional dynamics of agency, trust, and power in patient-provider relationships. Drawing from these findings, we conceptualize future LLMs as a longitudinal boundary companion that continuously mediates between patients and clinicians throughout longitudinal healthcare-seeking trajectories."}

While mobile applications provide convenient navigation support, they occupy the user's hands and visual attention, limiting natural interaction. In this paper, we explore conversation hand-off as a method for multi-device indoor navigation, where a Conversational Agent (CA) transitions seamlessly from a stationary social robot to a wearable device. We evaluated robot-only, wearable-only, and robot-to-wearable hand-off in a university campus setting using a within-subjects design with N=24 participants. We find that conversation hand-off is experienced as engaging, even though no performance benefits were observed, and most preferred using the wearable-only system. Our findings suggest that the design of such re-embodied assistants should maintain a shared voice and state across embodiments. We demonstrate how conversational hand-offs can bridge cognitive and physical transitions, enriching human interaction with embodied AI."}

TouchFusion combines surface electromyography (sEMG), bioimpedance, inertial, and optical sensing to capture multiple facets of hand activity during touch interactions. Through a combination of early and late fusion, TouchFusion enables stateful touch detection on both environmental and body surfaces, simple surface gestures, and tracking functionality for contextually adaptive interfaces as well as basic trackpad-like interactions. We validate our approach on a dataset of 100 participants, significantly exceeding the population size of typical wearable sensing studies to capture a wider variance of wrist anatomies, skin conductivities, and behavioral patterns. We show that TouchFusion can enable several common touch interaction tasks. Using TouchFusion, a wearer can summon a trackpad on any surface, control contextually adaptive interfaces based on where they tap, or use their palm as an always-available touch surface. When paired with smart glasses or augmented reality devices, TouchFusion enables a ubiquitous, contextually adaptive interaction model."}
