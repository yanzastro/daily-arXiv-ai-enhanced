We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment."}

It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference."}

IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), May 2026, Glasgow, UK", "summary": "We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems."}

Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training."}

In extended reality (XR), each step can be performed with the eyes, hands, and voice. To examine how design choices affect user performance, we evaluated four mode-switching (SemiPinch, FullPinch, DoublePinch, and Voice) and three subselection techniques (Gaze+Dwell, Gaze+Pinch, and Gaze+Voice) in a user study. Results revealed that while DoublePinch paired with Gaze+Pinch yielded the highest overall performance, SemiPinch achieved the lowest performance. Although Voice-based mode-switching showed benefits, Gaze+Voice subselection was less favored, as the required repetitive vocal commands were perceived as tedious. Overall, these findings provide empirical insights and inform design recommendations for multi-selection techniques in XR."}

This unique combination of characteristics seems to challenge the understanding that early loss of episodic memory may impede cognitive development and result in severe mental retardation. Although a few underlying mechanisms have been suggested, no computational model has been reported that is able to mimic the unique combination of characteristics. In this study, a cognitive system is presented, and developmental amnesia is demonstrated computationally in terms of impaired episodic recall, spared recognition and spared semantic learning. Impaired sequential/spatial learning ability of the hippocampus is suggested to be the cause of such amnesia. Simulation shows that impaired sequential leaning may only result in severe impairment of episodic recall, but affect neither recognition ability nor semantic learning. The spared semantic learning is inline with the view that semantic learning is largely associated with the consolidation of episodic memory, a process in which episodic memory may be mostly activated randomly, instead of sequentially. Furthermore, retrograded amnesia is also simulated, and the result and its mechanism are in agreement with most computational models of amnesia reported previously."}

In detail, we incorporated 77,000 HST pixels, in addition to the known 106 point-like multiple images, in our modeling. We considered four different models to explore the effect of the relative weighting of the point-like multiple image positions and flux distribution of the SN host on the model optimization. When the SN host's extended image is included, we find that the statistical uncertainties of all 34 free model parameters are reduced by factors ranging from one to two orders of magnitude compared to the statistical uncertainty of the point-like only model, irrespective of the adopted different image weights. We quantified the remarkably increased level of precision with which the cluster's total mass and the predicted time delays of the SN Refsdal multiple image positions can be reconstructed. We also show the delensed image of the SN host, a spiral galaxy at zSN = 1.49, in multiple HST bands. In all those applications, we obtain a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty, which is now below the level of even the small systematic uncertainty on the mass model that could be assessed by the different approaches. These results demonstrate that with extended image models of lensing clusters it is possible to measure the cluster's total mass distribution, the values of the cosmological parameters, and the physical properties of high-redshift sources with an unparalleled precision, making the typically not-quantified systematic uncertainties now crucial."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We investigate the physical origin of star formation suppression in gas-rich early-type galaxies using five high-resolution hydrodynamical idealized galaxy simulations, performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. These simulations include one Milky Way-like galaxy and four early-type galaxies, of which one early-type galaxy is found to have significantly less star formation despite a substantial molecular gas reservoir. We apply a modified virial theorem to the overdensities in each galaxy to quantify the forces regulating their stability and thus star formation. We find evidence that, in the suppressed galaxy, strong Coriolis forces driven by elevated galactic shear may inhibit gravitational collapse. This is caused by the galaxy's high central compactness, providing a physical mechanism for the suppression of star formation that does not require the removal of molecular gas. In contrast, less compact early-type galaxies host more gravity-dominated clouds and therefore exhibit higher star formation rates. However, we find that this gravitational stability occurs without significantly increasing the classical Toomre-Q parameter, and therefore a new criterion for suppressed star formation may be needed. We also discuss the impact of our choice of overdensity scale and connections to observations of molecular clouds."}

By this framework, the site-specific radio propagation environment is learned at the base station (BS), enabling the generation of high fidelity communication beams from coarse reference-signal-received-power (RSRP) feedback provided by user equipments (UEs). In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator. The proposed GenSSBF framework achieves beamforming performance nearly identical to maximum ratio transmission while requiring only eight probing beams and eight candidate beams."}

A 12-participant study shows clear ergonomic and performance benefits: compared with the conventional hover-style keyboard, users rated KeySense as markedly less physically demanding (NASA-TLX median 1.5 vs 4.0), and after brief practice typed significantly faster (WPM 28.3 vs 26.2, p < 0.01).

This cross-covariance is essential for joint analyses that combine full-shape clustering information with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, as commonly performed in modern spectroscopic surveys. Our model builds on the disconnected contribution to the covariance and accounts for the damping of correlations due to the BAO reconstruction process. We validate our analytic prescription against numerical simulations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), testing both idealized cubic geometries and realistic survey configurations including complex footprints and fiber assignment effects. Despite neglecting survey window functions in the analytic calculation, we find excellent agreement with simulation-based covariances and demonstrate that cosmological parameter constraints are virtually unchanged when using our approximation. Our results show that the pre-post cross-covariance is sufficiently small that even approximate treatments are adequate for cosmological inference, opening a pathway toward fully analytic covariance matrices for next-generation galaxy surveys."}

Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($λ_{\\rm Edd}=2.7\\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot})=7.55\\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators.

This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe."}

Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS).

We conduct a mixed-methods study (N=48) to compare how AI-generated multimodal content and embodied participation complement each other in supporting the understanding of literati gatherings and fostering cultural resonance. Our results show that AI-generated content effectively improves the readability of cultural symbols and initial emotional attraction, yet limitations in physical coherence and micro-level credibility may affect users' satisfaction. In contrast, embodied experience significantly deepens participants' understanding of ritual rules and social roles, and increases their psychological closeness and presence.

Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The analysis of the large-scale clustering of quasars (QSO) observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) represents a promising avenue for constraining local Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), parameterized by $f_{\\rm NL}$. The signal to be constrained is the scale-dependent bias induced in the 2-point clustering of the considered tracer sample. The resulting constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$, however, are fully degenerate with the local PNG bias parameter $b_φ$, dependent on the assembly bias parameter $p$. Using IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we select a QSO sample reflecting the selection criteria and properties of DESI QSOs, and provide a robust prior for $p$, and thus for $b_φ$, building on the findings of Fondi et al. 2024. We find a distribution with mean $\\bar{p}\\simeq1.4$ with weak redshift dependence, stable to selection noise and consistent with the expected recent merger history typical of quasar-hosting halos. By comparing with the CAMELS simulations we demonstrate that this prior is robust to astrophysical assumptions and cosmic variance. Finally, applying this prior to the DESI DR1 dataset, we derive updated constraints on local PNG, obtaining $f_{\\rm NL}=-3.3\\pm9.2$."}

We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters."}

OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature."}

Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey and BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we show that the inverse distance ladder is unable to explain the Hubble Tension, anchored as it is to the CMB and its value of $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To do so, we first show that the suite of systematics considered in cosmology analyses with SNe Ia only move the inferred $H_0$ by $<0.1$kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and second, we investigate the scale of redshift-dependent magnitude changes necessary to change the inferred inverse distance ladder $H_0$ from $67$ to the local network of distance measurements value of $73$, and the impact that this would have on other cosmological inferences with SNe Ia. We find that a change of $dμ/dz = 0.2$ mag would be necessary to infer an $H_0$ in concordance with local distance measurements, and that this $dμ/dz$ value would result in a Flat $Λ$CDM $Ω_M = 0.23$, $10σ$ discrepant with other cosmological probes, {indicating that the precision of SNe Ia measurements preclude the necessary redshift evolution for an $H_0$ of 74 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}. Therefore, we conclude that current SN Ia cosmology leaves little freedom for the inverse distance ladder to yield $H_0$ values significantly different from $67$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$."}

Using a mock lightcone built from the Millennium I Simulation plus a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we identified 7709 CGs when applying the standard Hickson-like criteria. For each CG, we placed 1000 random observers on a surrounding sphere and reapplied the velocity and compactness requirements to test recoverability. We also examined the variation of population and local isolation. The velocity concordance criterion shows modest sensitivity to the observer's location: 10% of CGs fail for some observers, typically groups with members with high peculiar velocities (>1000 km/s). The compactness requirement is far more fragile, as 44% of CGs are missed by most observers, and these systems are very elongated or are chance alignments in real space. Tightening selection limits reduces this dependence. Lowering the surface brightness threshold to $μ\\leq 23 \\ mag/arcsec^2$ reduces the compactness dependence to 16%, while reducing the velocity limit to $ΔV\\leq 250 \\ km/s$ lowers velocity-driven failures to less than 4%. Applying both cuts simultaneously yields up to 84% observer-independent groups, although with a substantially smaller sample. Population and isolation are affected by bright interlopers seen from different directions. While such interlopers are common, they have only a minor effect on the compactness and velocity concordance criteria; however, the local isolation is commonly broken. Observer frame effects, dominated by the compactness criterion, can significantly bias Hickson-like CG samples. However, adjusting surface brightness and velocity difference thresholds allows users to balance the physical reliability according to their specific scientific goals."}

Wireless ray tracing (RT) provides site-specific predictions but demands high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) environment models with material properties. Manual 3D model reconstruction achieves high accuracy but requires weeks of expert effort, creating scalability bottlenecks for large environment reconstruction. Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge."}

To study the oldest bulge stars, distributed in a spheroid, we applied kinematical and dynamical criteria in the metal-rich range [Fe/H] > -0.8. This complements our previous analysis of a symmetric sample with [Fe/H] < -0.8. We derived individual abundances through spectral synthesis for C, N, O, Al, P, S, K, Mn, and Ce using stellar parameters from APOGEE DR17, and compared the results with literature data and chemical-evolution models. The alpha elements Mg, Si, and Ca, and iron-peak elements V, Cr, Co, and Ni follow the expected trends relative to the models. Mn shows secondary behaviour. S and K display significant star-to-star scatter but remain broadly compatible with predictions. Phosphorus and cerium show an excess around [Fe/H] $\\sim$ -0.7, more pronounced than in the metal-poor sample, suggesting a distinctive signature of the earliest bulge population.

They are capable of reconstructing analytical functions directly from data points without introducing new physical models. A limitation of this approach is that while the reconstructed function is very efficient at reproducing the behaviour of the data points, non-observable quantities involving derivatives are particularly sensitive to stochasticity, hyperparameters, and to the choice of the best-fit function obtained by the GA, which implies the risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an update to the GA methodology for the reconstruction of analytical functions that involves computing a weighted average of an ensemble of GA configurations (\\texttt{GAME}). We define the weights via a quantity that accounts for both the goodness-of-fit of the points and the smoothness of the resulting function. We also present a practical method to analytically estimate and correct the errors on the averaged function by combining a path-integral approach with an ensemble variance. We demonstrate the improvement offered by \\texttt{GAME} methodology on a generic test function. We then apply the new methodology to a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ using Cosmic Chronometers data and, assuming a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background and General Relativity, we infer the corresponding dark energy equation of state $w(z)$.

To address this issue, the Chebyshev-time map is proposed in this paper, which is a method characterizing micro-Doppler signature using polynomial orders. The parametric kinematic models for human motion and the TWR echo model are first established.

We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic."}

In this paper, we exploit these properties to design a near-field beam pattern under a low exposure region constraint. We address the continuous region constraint through spatial discretization, which results in a large number of constraints that lead to prohibitive computational complexity. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm that enables a computationally tractable beam pattern design.

Our approach achieves low complexity while providing a power received at a target user close to the optimal achievable power, yet with uniform power mitigation over the low exposure region."}

Results show that social presence predicts all three needs, while self-presence predicts competence and relatedness, and spatial presence shows no direct or moderating effects. Gender and age moderated these relationships: women benefited more from social presence for autonomy and relatedness, men from self- and spatial presence for competence and autonomy, and younger users showed stronger associations between social presence and relatedness, and between self-presence and autonomy.

Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations."}

How do factors like location, setting, and context subtly shape our online communication, particularly in scenarios such as social support and topic-based discussions? Using Ohyay.co as a platform, we compared a normal gallery interface with a scene-based Room-type interface where participants are located in circular arrangement on screen in a social support task, and found that participants allocated attention to the group as a whole, and had pronounced self-awareness in the Room format. We then chose a two-sided topic for discussion in the Gallery interface and the Room interface where participants on each team face-off against each other, and found that they utilized spatial references to orient their allegiances, expressing greater engagement with those farther away in digital space and greater empathy with those closer, in the Room over the Gallery format. We found spatial effects in the way participants hide from the spotlight, in perspective-taking, and in their use of expressive gestures in time on the screen.

By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$α$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$α$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($λ_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\\sim 10^5-10^7\\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a \"Clumpy Envelope\" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure.

To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis."}

Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research."}

We analyzed contaminations related to host galaxies, particularly from polar dust, the interstellar medium, and stellar emission that affect the optical and infrared. We used a sample of nearly 400 quasars with photometrical observations and spectroscopical redshift divided into four redshift bins (0.7-2.4). Full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed with the CIGALE code, and results were compared with simplified photometric luminosity estimates. The impact of non-active galactic nucleus components and the role of polar dust in the fitting process were assessed. We show that for sources with a disk luminosity above 10^45 [erg/s], the photometric estimates are consistent with SED-based values. While polar dust contributes marginally to luminosity, its presence significantly alters SED fitting, particularly the torus opening angle and cold dust properties. In the optical domain, stellar emission is the dominant contamination. In the infrared, disk emission and cold dust play major roles. We propose two empirical calibrations for the OPT-IR relation. We conclude that the optical band is dominated by the accretion disk component above 10^45 or 10^46 [erg/s] depending on redshift, while IR luminosity is dominated by the dusty torus emission above 1.6 $\\times$ 10^45 or 2 $\\times$ 10^46 [erg/s] depending on the redshift.

The aim is to assess how imaging modality influences user performance, usability, and trust during AR-assisted spinal procedures.\n  Methods: Both imaging systems were integrated into an AR framework, enabling in situ visualization and trajectory guidance. The ultrasound-based workflow combined AR-guided robotic scanning, probabilistic shape completion, and AR visualization. The CBCT-based workflow used AR-assisted scan volume planning, CBCT acquisition, and AR visualization. A between-subject user study was conducted and evaluated in two phases: (1) planning and image acquisition, and (2) needle insertion.\n  Results: Planning time was significantly shorter with the CBCT-based workflow, while SUS, SEQ, and NASA-TLX were comparable between modalities. In the needle insertion phase, the CBCT-based workflow yielded marginally faster insertion times, lower placement error, and better subjective ratings with higher Trust. The ultrasound-based workflow achieved adequate accuracy for facet joint insertion, but showed larger errors for lumbar puncture, where reconstructions depended more heavily on shape completion.\n  Conclusion: The findings indicate that both AR-guided imaging pipelines are viable for spinal intervention support. CBCT-based AR offers advantages in efficiency, precision, usability, and user confidence during insertion, whereas ultrasound-based AR provides adaptive, radiation-free imaging but is limited by shape completion in deeper spinal regions.

STEPping stones between the clouds: the star formation history of the Magellanic Bridge", "comment": "Accepted for publication on Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the evolution of dwarf galaxies. By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\\mathrm{deg\\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\\leq[$Fe/H$]\\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total stellar mass in the Bridge of $ (5.1 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ and a present-day stellar metallicity of $[$Fe/H$]\\sim0.6$ dex, close to SMC value."}

On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication."}

Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \\lesssim \\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\\star \\sim 10^7 M_\\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \\texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation.

We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations."}

To address this imbalance, we introduce Human Tool, an MCP-style interface abstraction, building on recent Model Context Protocol designs, that exposes humans as callable tools within AI-led, proactive workflows. Here, \"tool\" denotes a coordination abstraction, not a reduction of human authority or responsibility. Building on LLM-based agent architectures, we operationalize Human Tool by modeling human contributions through structured tool schemas of capabilities, information, and authority. These schemas enable agents to dynamically invoke human input based on relative strengths and reintegrate it through efficient, natural interaction protocols. We validate the framework through controlled studies in both decision-making and creative tasks, demonstrating improved task performance, reduced human workload, and more balanced collaboration dynamics compared to baseline systems. Finally, we discuss implications for human-centered AI design, highlighting how MCP-style human tools enable strong AI leadership while amplifying uniquely human strengths."}

Main text: 20 pages, 9 figures. Data url will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, having recently experienced a starburst followed by rapid quenching, are excellent laboratories to probe physical mechanisms that drive starbursts and shutting down of star formation. Integral-field spectroscopy reveals the galaxies' spatially-resolved properties, where observed directional patterns can be linked to the galaxies' past evolution. We measure the resolved star-formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicity evolution and dust properties of three local PSBs from the MaNGA survey, down to $0.5$\" resolution ($\\sim0.3\\,$kpc) using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Local parameters were constrained simultaneously with parameters describing spatial trends. We found that all three galaxies first experienced an outer, weaker and slower quenching starburst, followed by a central, stronger and faster quenching starburst that peaked $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr after the first. The central starbursts induced a significantly stronger rise in stellar metallicity compared to the outer starbursts. These results are consistent with the effects of a recent gas-rich (wet) merger, where the first pericentre passage triggered starbursts in the outer regions, while the later coalescence triggers a stronger centralised starburst. We find non-axisymmetric features in the maps of burst mass fraction and dust attenuation in all galaxies, which could be caused by tidal effects during the recent merger. Comparisons with literature binary merger simulations suggests that the galaxies' rapid quenching was driven by gas consumption and the stabilisation against gas gravitational collapse by a growing spheroid, while AGN feedback was not necessarily a primary cause."}

Community-based small farms, while offering unique social and cultural benefits, face persistent challenges, including limited access to formal education and underdeveloped infrastructure, which have been discussed in prior research. This study focuses on community-driven factors, such as workarounds for recording critical information and practices for passing down farming knowledge across generations. Through 11 semi-structured interviews with farmers from a small ethnic community, the Hmong, we explore how bonding social capital, rooted in close family and community ties, supports informal knowledge exchange and creates pathways to bridging and linking capital. These relationships help farmers connect to broader networks, resources, and institutions. Our findings highlight opportunities for designing technologies that support and strengthen existing support systems. We discuss how technologies should be designed to reflect the cultural values, unique practices, and intergenerational relationships embedded in community-based farms."}

II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry", "comment": "18 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted in ApJ", "summary": "We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$."}

From a user's verbal preferences for changing a UI, our framework guides a prioritization-based Pareto frontier search over candidate layouts. It selects suitable objective functions for UI placement while simultaneously parameterizing them according to the user's instructions to define the optimization problem. A solver then generates a series of optimal UI layouts, which our framework validates against the user's instructions to adapt the UI with the final solution. Our approach thus overcomes the previous need for manual inspection of layouts and the use of population averages for objective parameters. We integrate multiple agents sequentially within our framework, enabling the system to leverage their reasoning capabilities to interpret user preferences, configure the optimization problem, and validate optimization outcomes."}

We present APPO, a preference-guided prompt optimization algorithm. Instead of iterating prompts, users only provide binary preferential feedback. APPO adaptively balances its strategies between exploiting user feedback and exploring new directions, yielding effective and efficient optimization. We evaluate APPO on image generation, and the results show APPO enables achieving satisfactory outcomes in fewer iterations with lower cognitive load than manual prompt editing. We anticipate APPO will advance human-AI collaboration in generative tasks by leveraging user preferences to guide complex content creation."}
