Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals."}

A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $β$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region. These findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of plant-plant communication and for developing next-generation precision farming technologies."}

Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries."}

While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis."}

A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example.

Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups."}

To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($σ_0$).

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging."}

These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies."}

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\\sim$10$\\%$ of the cosmological average $\\frac{Ω_b}{Ω_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos.

Drawing from media coverage, legal documents, and academic literature, we elucidate forms and characteristics of DSV cases in each era, tracing how entrenched misogyny is reconfigured and amplified through evolving technologies, alongside shifting legislative measures. Taking a genealogical approach to read prominent cases of different eras, our analysis identifies three constitutive and interconnected dimensions of DSV: (1) the homo-social fabrication of \"obscenity\", wherein victims' imagery becomes collectively framed as obscene through participatory practices in male-dominant networks; (2) the increasing imperceptibility of violence, as technologies foreclose victims' ability to perceive harm; and (3) the commercialization of abuse through decentralized economic infrastructures.

While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\\rm S\\acute{e}rsic} \\sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys."}

While digital interventions promise personalization, many remain one-size-fits-all and fail to reflect parents' lived practices. We present CalmReminder, a watch-based system that detects children's calm moments and delivers just-in-time prompts to parents. Through a four-week deployment with 16 families (twelve completed) of children with ADHD, we compared notification strategies ranging from hourly to random to only when the child was inferred to be calm. Our sensing-based notifications were frequently perceived as arriving during calm moments. More importantly, parents adopted the system in diverse ways: using notifications for praise, mindfulness, activity planning, or conversation. These findings show that parents are not passive recipients but active designers, reshaping interventions to fit their parenting styles. We contribute a calm detection pipeline, empirical insights into families' flexible appropriation of notifications, and design implications for intervention systems that foster agency."}

Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency."}

Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows."}

To decouple the passively combined uplink signal and to provide per-segment observability, tagged pilots are employed. A simple tag is attached to each segment and is used to apply a known low-rate modulation at the segment feed, which assigns a unique signature to each segment. Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted.

This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models."}

The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics."}

Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values."}

We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system.

A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling."}

Over two weeks, workers in the treatment group completed brief pre-meeting surveys in their collaboration platform, nudging attention to goals for upcoming meetings. To measure impact, both treatment and control groups completed post-meeting surveys about meeting effectiveness. While the intervention impact on meeting effectiveness was not statistically significant, mixed-methods findings revealed improvements in self-reported awareness and behaviour across both groups, with post-meeting surveys unintentionally functioning as an intervention. We highlight the promise of supporting goal reflection, while noting challenges of evaluating and supporting workplace reflection for meetings, including workflow and collaboration norms, and attitudes and behaviours around meeting preparation. We conclude with implications for designing technological support for meeting intentionality."}

In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles.

Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $β$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z>7$. We want measure $β$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \\b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$β$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $β=-2.3\\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\\pm1$. We find no significant $β$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $β-z$ trend above $z\\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $β$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $β$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $β$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value."}

While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time.

Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters."}

We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets."}

StoryLensEdu integrates three agents: a Data Analyst that extracts data insights based on a learning objective centered structure, a Teacher that ensures educational relevance and offers actionable suggestions, and a Storyteller that organizes these insights using the Heroes Journey narrative framework.

The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin."}

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered."}

We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging."}

While the CA's composite personality did not affect participants' decisions, it did affect their perceptions and emotional responses. Particularly, participants interacting with pessimistic CAs felt lower emotional state and lower affinity towards the cause, perceived the CA as less trustworthy and less competent, and yet tended to donate more toward the charity. Perceptions of trust, competence, and situational empathy significantly predicted donation decisions.

The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\\perp}$.

While recent LLM-based approaches partially reduce this burden, they struggle to generate effective analysis plans and appropriate insights and visualizations when user intent is abstract. Meanwhile, a vast collection of analysis notebooks produced across platforms and organizations contains rich analytical knowledge that can potentially guide automated EDA. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a natural way to leverage such corpora, but general methods often treat notebooks as static documents and fail to fully exploit their potential knowledge for automating EDA. To address these limitations, we propose NotebookRAG, a method that takes user intent, datasets, and existing notebooks as input to retrieve, enhance, and reuse relevant notebook content for automated EDA generation. For retrieval, we transform code cells into context-enriched executable components, which improve retrieval quality and enable rerun with new data to generate updated visualizations and reliable insights. For generation, an agent leverages enhanced retrieval content to construct effective EDA plans, derive insights, and produce appropriate visualizations. Evidence from a user study with 24 participants confirms the superiority of our method in producing high-quality and intent-aligned EDA notebooks."}

But, while AI tutors have shown promise in introductory programming courses, no work has evaluated their use in hands-on exploration and exploitation of systems (e.g., ``capture-the-flag'') commonly used to teach cybersecurity. Thus, despite growing interest and need, no work has evaluated how students use AI tutors or whether they benefit from their presence in real, large-scale cybersecurity courses. To answer this, we conducted a semester-long observational study on the use of an embedded AI tutor with 309 students in an upper-division introductory cybersecurity course. By analyzing 142,526 student queries sent to the AI tutor across 396 cybersecurity challenges spanning 9 core cybersecurity topics and an accompanying set of post-semester surveys, we find (1) what queries and conversational strategies students use with AI tutors, (2) how these strategies correlate with challenge completion, and (3) students' perceptions of AI tutors in cybersecurity education. In particular, we identify three broad AI tutor conversational styles among users: Short (bounded, few-turn exchanges), Reactive (repeatedly submitting code and errors), and Proactive (driving problem-solving through targeted inquiry). We also find that the use of these styles significantly predicts challenge completion, and that this effect increases as materials become more advanced. Furthermore, students valued the tutor's availability but reported that it became less useful for harder material. Based on this, we provide suggestions for security educators and developers on practical AI tutor use."}

Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the research sample consisted of 10 children aged 4 to 7 years, with IQ scores ranging from 90 to 110. Participants were divided into an experimental group and a control group, with the experimental group receiving a structured VR intervention over three months, totaling 36 sessions. Assessment tools included the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (5th Edition), the Conners Test for ADHD, and a researcher-prepared Body Awareness Scale.\n  The results indicated statistically significant differences between pre-test and post-test scores for the experimental group, demonstrating the program's efficacy in enhancing spatial awareness, body part identification, and motor expressions. Furthermore, follow-up assessments conducted one month after the intervention revealed no significant differences from the post-test results, confirming the sustainability and continuity of the program's effects over time. The findings suggest that immersive VR environments provide a safe, engaging, and effective therapeutic medium for addressing psychomotor deficits in early childhood ADHD."}
