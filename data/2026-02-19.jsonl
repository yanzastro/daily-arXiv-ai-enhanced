Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience."}

In other words, independently trained embeddings from text, vision, audio, and neural signals share an underlying geometry. We call this the Representational Alignment Hypothesis (RAH) and investigate evidence for and consequences of this claim. The evidence is of two kinds: (i) internal structure comparison techniques, such as representational similarity analysis and topological data analysis, reveal matching relational patterns across modalities without explicit mapping; and (ii) methods based on cross-modal embedding alignment, which learn mappings between representation spaces, show that simple linear transformations can bring different embedding spaces into close correspondence, suggesting near-isomorphism. Taken together, the evidence suggests that, even after controlling for trivial commonalities inherent in standard data preprocessing and embedding procedures, a robust structural correspondence persists, hinting at an underlying organizational principle. Some have argued that this result shows that the shared structure is getting at a fundamental, Platonic level of reality. We argue that this conclusion is unjustified. Moreover, we aim to give the idea an alternative philosophical home, rooted in contemporary metasemantics (i.e., theories of what makes a representation and what makes something meaningful) and responses to the symbol grounding problem. We conclude by considering the scope of the RAH and proposing new ways of distinguishing semantic structures that are genuinely invariant from those that inevitably arise due to the fact that all our data is generated under human-specific conditions on Earth."}

The effect of the averaging scale on the characterization of interstellar turbulence", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "In interstellar medium studies, separating ordered and random velocity or magnetic fields is essential for interpreting turbulence in both simulations and observations. We investigate how the choice of averaging scale affects the measurement and characterization of magnetic and kinetic turbulence in Milky Way-sized disk galaxies with different initial magnetic morphologies. We analyze two magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies, one initialized with a toroidal magnetic field (Model T) and the other with a random field (Model R). Using spherical filtering, we decompose the magnetic and velocity fields into mean and fluctuating components while varying the averaging scale, and examine their energy ratios and power spectra as functions of time and averaging radius. Both models develop ordered and turbulent magnetic structures, whose relative strengths vary strongly with the averaging radius. The power spectra of the velocity and magnetic mean fields steepen with increasing smoothing scale, tracing the transition from coherent to turbulent regimes. The turbulent kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic counterpart, though the latter remains dynamically significant. Very importantly, we find that these ratios depend more strongly on the averaging radius than on the initial conditions of the magnetic field. The characterization of turbulence as strong or weak, meaning whether or not fluctuations dominate over the mean depends sensitively on the chosen averaging scale, rather than being an intrinsic property of the system. The strong dependence of the turbulence fractions on the averaging scale has direct implications for magnetic field estimates obtained from observational methods such as the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique emphasizing the need for careful scale selection when interpreting magnetic and kinetic turbulence in galaxies."}

However, existing agent-related protocols focus on agent-to-agent interactions, leaving humans as external observers rather than integrated participants within the agent systems. This limitation arises from the lack of a standardized mechanism for agents to discover, address, and interact with humans across heterogeneous messaging platforms. In this paper, we propose the A2H (Agent-to-Human) protocol, a unified protocol that enables humans to be registered, discovered, and communicated with by AI agents as resolvable entities within agent systems. A2H contributes three key components: (1) Human Card for registering human identities via resolvable domain names, making them discoverable to agents; (2) Formal Communication Schema defines when, why, and how agents contact with human;(3) Unified Messaging Abstraction standardizes diverse communication medias and transforms complex JSON outputs into human-friendly formats. This work establishes a foundational protocol for integrating humans into agent ecosystems, advancing AI agents from isolated autonomous systems toward truly human-connected intelligent infrastructures."}

To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios."}

We select our sample of galaxy clusters by choosing the most round and virialised objects among the targets of the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic program, which offers a large spectral database. Complementary MUSE observations on most of these clusters allowed us to identify an unprecedented number of cluster members, strongly enhancing the precision of our measurement with respect to previous studies. Our sample of cluster members is divided in four classes: red and blue by colour, and high- and low-mass by stellar mass. We employ two parallel techniques, namely the MAMPOSSt method (parametric in $β(r)$) and the Jeans equation inversion (non parametric in $β(r)$). The results from both techniques are found in agreement for any given cluster member population, and suggest that the orbital anisotropy in galaxy clusters grows from the centre (where $β\\approx 0.2-0.4$) to the virial radius ($β\\gtrsim 0.8$), and it is similar for the different cluster member populations. We also find an interesting dynamical feature in the Jeans inversion results, that is a drop in $β(r)$ at a distance of $\\sim 250$ kpc from the cluster centre. We provide robust anisotropy estimates by exploring a highly significant number of model combinations: 72 with MAMPOSSt (varying the mass, surface number density, $β(r)$ model, and galaxy population) and 18 (varying total mass model and galaxy population) in the Jeans inversion. Such an extensive investigation of the $β(r)$ profile in galaxy clusters is a wide basis for future studies on cluster dynamical masses and cluster cosmology in the era of large spectroscopic surveys"}

To address this core concern, this work explores the task of identifying relevant but unknown personas of the simulation target for a given simulation context. We introduce PICQ, a novel dataset of context-aware choice questions, annotated with unknown personas (e.g., ''Is the user price-sensitive?'') that may influence user choices, and propose a multi-faceted evaluation scheme assessing fidelity, influence, and inaccessibility. Our benchmark of leading LLMs reveals a complex ''Fidelity vs. Insight'' dilemma governed by model scale: while influence generally scales with model size, fidelity to human patterns follows an inverted U-shaped curve. We trace this phenomenon to cognitive differences, particularly the human tendency for ''cognitive economy.'' Our work provides the first comprehensive benchmark for this crucial task, offering a new lens for understanding the divergent cognitive models of humans and advanced LLMs."}

Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $Ω_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $Ω_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by ~80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging."}

Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing."}

Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\\log_{10}(M_\\ast$/$M_\\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations.

The results show that at redshift $z=0$, the monopole of both MG models is suppressed compared to $Λ$CDM, with the Symmetron being closer to the standard model, while the quadrupole presents the opposite behavior.

HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way."}

Our analysis is based on a tree-level redshift-space bispectrum template, which is then transformed to position space using the Fast Fourier Transform on Logarithmic scales (FFTLog) algorithm. We detect the BAO feature with a significance of approximately $8.1σ$ using the EZmock covariance matrix and $8.5σ$ using the analytical covariance matrix, for the full LRG redshift range ($0.4<z<1.1$), denoted as the $z_{\\rm full}$ sample. We use the Abacus altMTL mocks, the most precise DESI DR1 mock catalogs currently available, to validate our model. We find that our model fits the mocks well, with a small offset of $0.6\\%$ in the recovered BAO scale, which we treat as a systematic error due to modeling. We measure the angle-averaged distance, $D_{\\rm V}(z = 0.68)/r_{\\rm d} = 15.88 \\pm 0.27$ ($1.72\\%$ precision) when using the covariance matrix estimated from EZmocks and $D_{\\rm V}(z = 0.68)/r_{\\rm d} = 15.72 \\pm 0.18$ ($1.12\\%$ precision) when using the analytical Gaussian covariance matrix. Our results show excellent agreement with the DESI DR1 2PCF BAO measurements as well. We also explore several other ways to estimate the error and find between $1.7$--$2.2\\%$ precision on the BAO scale from the EZmock covariance matrix and between $1.1$--$1.5\\%$ precision from the analytical covariance matrix. This work represents the first detection of the BAO feature in the DESI 3PCF, establishing its ability to probe the expansion history of the Universe with future DESI 3PCF measurements."}

For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak."}

Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population."}

Online engagement is complex and efforts to regulate online use face challenges in distinguishing between beneficial and harmful content and behaviours. An alternative approach is to help young people develop the skills they need to manage online safety while preserving the benefits of online interactions. This dissertation presents the entire development process and evaluation of an multi-platform application, called EmoTrack that aims to help young people reflect on their online behaviour. It was developed to record their online activities and cultivate strategies for more positive and mindful engagement online. EmoTrack is a personal informatics system, and it is designed to help people track and reflect on their engagement with YouTube videos. The system was evaluated with thirteen participants and it was found that EmoTrack can facilitate them to reflect on their video watching behaviour and the impact on their mood, with reports of different levels of reflections from R0 to R3."}

Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium."}

In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs."}

Or not", "comment": "9 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $σ_{\\rm SI}\\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one"}

In this study, by synthesizing Human-AI Interaction (HAI) literature, we analyze this distinction across four dimensions: interaction design, trust calibration, collaborative frameworks and healthcare applications. Our analysis reveals that static interfaces and miscalibrated trust limit AI efficacy. Performance hinges on aligning transparency with cognitive workflows, yet a fluency trap often inflates trust without improving decision-making. Consequently, an overemphasis on explainability leaves systems largely passive. Our findings show that current AI systems remain largely passive due to an overreliance on explainability-centric designs and that transitioning AI to an active teammate requires adaptive, context-aware interactions that support shared mental models and the dynamic negotiation of authority between humans and AI."}

The radio halo in this cluster is detected for the first time at this frequency with a statistical significance higher than $3σ$.

By using the value we obtained, it is possible to estimate an integrated spectral index between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz of $α\\sim1.17$, where $F(ν)\\propto ν^{-α}$, indicating a possible higher-frequency slowdown of the spectral steepening observed between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Such a spectral behavior is compatible with turbulent re-acceleration if the seed electrons have a spectrum extending up to high energies, as in the case of continuous injection by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation. We also report the detection at 4.8 GHz of a polarized spot inside the halo, without an evident counterpart, already detected at 6.6 GHz."}

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."}

The catalogues, images and uv-data associated with this data release are publicly available via https://lofar-surveys.org/", "summary": "We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

Live performances, such as comedy, rely on subtle social cues between performers and audiences, which are missing in VR. However, it remains unclear how comedians utilize avatar-mediated cues in social VR. We conducted semi-structured interviews and observations with 23 virtual comedians on VRChat. Results revealed that virtual comedians transformed their limited nonverbal expressiveness into performative opportunities through intentional control and exaggeration. Additionally, a distinctive culture emerged around context-appropriate emoji reactions from audiences, while challenges such as audio latency and moderation against trolling were highlighted. Our findings advance understanding of how performers creatively adapt to expressive constraints in avatar-mediated settings. We further demonstrate how challenges in performer-audience interaction and moderation provide design insights for systems enhancing feedback visibility and sustain community norms without restricting creative expression."}

Among these, the intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies are one of the dominant contaminants of the weak lensing (WL) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) probes. In this work, we assess IA modelling choices for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses by comparing the performance of the two most commonly used IA models, nonlinear alignment (NLA) and tidal alignment tidal torquing (TATT), along with several variations. Our analyses combine three perspectives: i) the constraining power on the IA and cosmological parameters for each IA model, ii) the bias that results when the IA analysis model differs from the model used to generate the synthetic data vector, and iii) the degeneracies between IA and photometric redshift (photo-z) nuisance parameters. Among the IA models analysed, the redshift-dependent TATT model (zTATT) provides the most flexible description of IA, with a similar constraining power compared to simpler IA models, making it a well-motivated choice for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses."}

Still, it comes at a cost of inherent nonlinearities, geometry-dependent noise, and suboptimal weighting in conventional linear estimators that might limit accuracy. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to directly map RSS-AoA measurements to 3D positions, capturing nonlinear relationships that are difficult to model with traditional methods. We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction."}

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion."}

Yet few interventions teaching students to prompt AI as a tutor rather than solution provider have been validated at scale through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To bridge this gap, we conducted a semester-long RCT (N=979) with four ICAP framework-based instructional conditions varying in engagement intensity with a pre-test, immediate and delayed post-test and surveys. Mixed methods analysis results showed: (1) All conditions significantly improved prompting skills, with gains increasing progressively from Condition 1 to Condition 4, validating ICAP's cognitive engagement hierarchy; (2) for students with similar pre-test scores, higher learning gain in immediate post-test predict higher final exam score, though no direct between-group differences emerged; (3) Our interventions are suitable and scalable solutions for diverse educational contexts, resources and learners. Together, this study makes empirical and theoretical contributions: (1) theoretically, we provided one of the first large-scale RCTs examining how cognitive engagement shapes learning in prompting literacy and clarifying the relationship between learning-oriented prompting skills and broader academic performance; (2) empirically, we offered timely design guidance for transforming GenAI classroom policies into scalable, actionable prompting literacy instruction to advance learning in the era of Generative AI."}

However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe.

We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes."}

An N-body approach to the problem", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the A&A Letter", "summary": "Recent observations indicate that in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars appear more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. This contradicts most multiple stellar population (MSP) formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched (second) population (2P) should initially be more concentrated than the pristine (first) population (1P). Previous MOCCA Monte Carlo simulations suggested that this apparent overconcentration is a transient effect arising in clusters that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass and host an active black hole subsystem (BHS), and is visible only when RGB stars are used as tracers. In this letter, we test this interpretation using tailored NBODY6++GPU models evolved with direct N-body simulations, providing an independent validation that does not rely on a statistical treatment of relaxation. We performed direct N-body simulations with the NBODY6++GPU code, adopting initial conditions designed to reproduce the dynamical regime relevant to the proposed mechanism. The simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and the Galactic tidal field, enabling a direct comparison with MOCCA results. The simulations confirm that the spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars can be strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with the BHS. Preferential ejection of 2P RGB and their progenitors from the cluster center leads to a transient apparent overconcentration of 1P RGB stars, in agreement with earlier MOCCA predictions."}

The topology of ionized regions allows us to infer the nature and properties of ionizing sources, i.e., early galaxies and AGNs. Traditional Fourier statistics, such as the power spectrum, help us quantify the strength of fluctuations in this field at different length scales but do not preserve its phase information. Analyzing the 21-cm brightness temperature field in the image domain retains its non-Gaussian characteristics and morphological information. One such approach is to track the coalescence of multiple ionized regions to form one contiguous ionized region spanning the universe. This is referred to as percolation, and its onset is quantified by a sharp rise in the value of the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS) approaching unity. In this work, we carry out a percolation analysis of 21-cm brightness temperature fields by studying the redshift evolution of the LCS along a lightcone to distinguish between several simulated reionization scenarios. We have extended previous results on reionization model comparison from the analysis of coeval 21-cm maps to understand how the lightcone effect biases the observed percolation behavior and affects the distinguishability of the source models. We estimate the LCS of subvolumes of different sizes in the 21-cm lightcone maps and study their redshift evolution for different reionization scenarios using a moving volume approach. We find that the percolation transition inferred from a lightcone approaches that from the coeval box as we increase the bandwidth of the moving volume in all but one reionization scenario."}

Since conventional methods typically reconstruct the original signal by estimating the differences of the residual signal and computing their cumulative sum, each estimation error inevitably propagates through subsequent time samples. In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal."}

Our analysis revealed tensions around access in both institutions: they either marginalized blind students within society at large or imposed pressures to conform to sighted norms. Both institutions were further constrained by systemic issues, including limited accessible resources, pervasive ableist cultures, and the lack of formalized policies.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum provides the standard initial conditions for cosmological perturbations. However, the largest scales remain only weakly constrained by CMB observations, leaving room for deviations such as an infrared (IR) cut-off. This possibility is further motivated by the persistence of large-scale CMB anomalies, most notably the low quadrupole power. In this work, we revisit several broad classes of phenomenologically motivated IR cut-off scenarios using parametrised functional forms of the primordial power spectrum. We confront these models with the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova data and derive updated constraints on the cut-off scale and associated features. Our results remain consistent with earlier studies, showing that although such models suppress power at low multipoles, the improvement in fit is marginal and does not overcome the associated parameter penalties. We therefore find no statistically significant evidence favouring IR cut-off models over the standard power-law spectrum with current data. We further explore the interplay between IR cut-off features and a possible increase in the reionisation optical depth, motivated by the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 within the $Λ$CDM framework. We show that the additional freedom introduced by large-scale suppression is generally insufficient to support a substantial increase in optical depth, owing to the weak statistical preference for suppressed large-scale temperature power. Finally, we examine the implications of IR cut-off models for large-scale CMB anomalies by analysing the corresponding anomaly statistics within a Bayesian framework."}

This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds."}

When complete, CLIFS will form a sample of 29 jellyfish galaxies in Coma, selected based on the presence of one-sided tails in the radio continuum, enabling a comprehensive picture of the effects of ram pressure on galaxies in the Coma cluster. We extract emission line properties and confirm consistency between disk fluxes measured from WEAVE and MaNGA for galaxies with overlapping disk coverage between surveys. Comparing resolved radio and H$α$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$α$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$α$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks.

Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\\log_{10}(M_\\ast$/$M_\\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations.

It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6<E<13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $α$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope."}

Drawing on individual and group interviews, we found that teachers' perspectives became more situated, grounding their understanding in everyday contexts; more critical, reflecting growing awareness of harms; and more agentic, highlighting possibilities for action. Further, across all three perspectives, teachers consistently framed algorithmic justice through their role as educators, situating their concerns within their school communities. In the discussion, we consider the ways teachers' perspectives shifted, how AI auditing can shape these shifts, and the implications of these findings on AI literacy for both teachers and students."}

When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $σ_{\\rm SI}\\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one"}

Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements."}

Lens models of binary lens galaxies with five images of Supernova Winny", "comment": null, "summary": "Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) provide a powerful way to study cosmology, SNe and galaxies. Modelling the lens system is key to extracting astrophysical and cosmological information. We present adaptive-optics-assisted high-resolution images of SN Winny (SN 2025wny) in the J and K filters obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT imaging confirms the presence of a fifth point source, whose colour is consistent with that of the other SN images at similar phases, while lens modelling robustly supports its interpretation as an additional image of SN~Winny. We measure the positions of the five SN images with uncertainties varying between 1 and 14 milliarcseconds. We build the first mass models using lenstronomy and GLEE, and explore three classes of mass models for the two lens galaxies G1 and G2. The optimal model class of the three is a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1, a singular isothermal sphere for G2, and an external shear. We infer the enclosed masses within the Einstein radius as 4.61^{+0.06}_{-0.04} \\times 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot for G1 and 1.01\\pm0.02 \\times 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot for G2. The lensing configuration by the two lens galaxies can produce two additional magnified SN images beyond the five observed ones; the exclusion of such model configurations further constrains the lens model parameters. Our model fits to the observed image positions with an RMS of ~0.0012\" - 0.0025\", within the observed positional uncertainties. The predicted magnifications of the multiple images vary between ~1.6 (for the faintest fifth image E) to ~10 (for the brightest image A). The predicted relative lensing magnifications of the multiple images do not match that of the observed within 2σuncertainties. The differences in the relative magnifications could be due to millilensing/microlensing. Our mass models form the basis for future analyses of this unique system. (abridged)"}

While prior studies have investigated the potential of integrating large language models (LLMs) into BEMS or building energy modeling, very few studies have examined how user interact with such systems. We conducted a systematic role-playing experiment, where 85 human subjects interacted with an advanced generative pre-trained transformer (OpenAI GPT-4o). Participants were tasked with identifying the top five behavioral changes that could reduce home energy use with the GPT model that functioned as an LLM-integrated BEMS. Then, the collected prompt-response data and participant conclusions were analyzed using an analytical framework that hierarchically assessed and scored human-AI interactions and their home energy analysis approaches. Also, participants were classified into four groups based on their self-evaluated domain knowledge of building energy use and AI literacy, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted across 20 quantifiable metrics. Key takeaways include: most participants employed concise prompts (median: 16.2 words) and relied heavily on GPT's analytical capabilities; and notably, only 1 of 20 metrics, appliance identification rate, showed statistically significant group differences (p=0.037), driven by AI literacy rather than domain knowledge, suggesting an equalizing effect of LLMs across expertise levels. This study provides foundational insights into human-AI collaboration dynamics and promising development directions in the context of LLM-integrated BEMS and contributes to realizing human-centric LLM-integrated energy systems."}

The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions."}

The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported."}

Inspired by rapid-prototyping in manufacturing, we propose a fast, low-cost evaluation method using Vision-Language Model (VLM) personas to simulate outcomes comparable to field results. While LLMs show human-like reasoning and language capabilities, autonomous vehicle (AV)-pedestrian interaction requires spatial awareness, emotional empathy, and behavioral generation. This raises our research question: To what extent can VLM personas mimic human responses in field studies? We conducted parallel studies: 1) one real-world study with 20 participants, and 2) one video-study using 20 VLM personas, both on a street-crossing task. We compared their responses and interviewed five HCI researchers on potential applications. Results show that VLM personas mimic human response patterns (e.g., average crossing times of 5.25 s vs. 5.07 s) lack the behavioral variability and depth. They show promise for formative studies, field study preparation, and human data augmentation."}

By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion."}

Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium."}

Considering engagement modes across these two actions reveals nuanced reliance patterns: for example, a student may actively engage in help-seeking by clearly specifying areas of need, yet engage passively in response-use by copying AI outputs, or vice versa. However, existing research lacks systematic tools for jointly capturing engagement across help-seeking and response-use, limiting the analysis of such reliance behaviors. We introduce RelianceScope, an analytical framework that characterizes students' reliance on chatbots during problem-solving. RelianceScope (1) operationalizes reliance into nine patterns based on combinations of engagement modes in help-seeking and response-use, and (2) situates these patterns within a knowledge-context lens that accounts for students' prior knowledge and the instructional significance of knowledge components. Rather than prescribing optimal AI use, the framework enables fine-grained analysis of reliance in open-ended student-AI interactions. As an illustrative application, we applied RelianceScope to analyze chat and code-edit logs from 79 college students in a web programming course. Results show that active help-seeking is associated with active response-use, whereas reliance patterns remain similar across knowledge mastery levels. Students often struggled to articulate their knowledge gaps and to adapt AI responses. Using our annotated dataset as a benchmark, we further demonstrate that large language models can reliably detect reliance during help-seeking and response-use. We conclude by discussing the implications of RelianceScope and the design guidelines for AI-supported educational systems."}

To address this gap, we conducted a five-day field study with 40 participants, combining objective smartphone app tracking with daily reconstructions of flow-inducing activities. Across 673 reported flow occurrences, participants rarely associated flow with social media (2 percent). Instead, heavier social media use predicted fewer daily flow occurrences. We further examine this relationship through the effects of social media use on fatigue, mood, and motivation. Altogether, our findings suggest that flow and social media may not align as closely as assumed - and might even compete - underscoring the need for further research."}
